The image you provided is a flowchart diagram that outlines the process and interactions involved in a live streaming event using a Video SDK integrated with the Agora platform's SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network).

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the sequence:

1. **User**
   - Opens the app, initiating the Video SDK engine (`AgoraRTC.createClient`).

2. **Host**
   - Starts video and local media streams in the SDK.
   - Retrieves an authentication token, sets the role as host (`setClientRole("host")`), joins a channel, and then publishes local media to the channel.

3. **Audience**
   - Joins the live streaming event.
   - Retrieves an authentication token, sets their user role as an audience, joins the stream, and subscribes to receive the data stream from the host.

4. **Leaving the Event**
   - Both host and audience leave the live streaming event using the `agoraEngine.leave` command.
  
5. **Software Interaction**
   - Interactions between the app, Video SDK, and Agora's SD-RTN are visible, with each step mapped out clearly, showing the sequential logic and collaboration between user, host, audience, and back-end services.

This flowchart is essential for understanding the structure and system flow handling in the software during a live streaming setup, particularly useful for developers integrating the Agora Video SDK into their applications.
