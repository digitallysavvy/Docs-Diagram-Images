The image is a flowchart that illustrates the process involved for a user interacting with a multimedia (specifically video) software development kit (SDK), utilizing Agora's technology services for live streaming. The flowchart details the sequence of operations from initiating the Agora engine through the app to handling multi-channel live streaming and properly exiting said streams. 

Key operations include:

1. **Opening the App and Initiating the Agora Engine**: Establishing the connection with the Agora service.
   
2. **Joining a Channel and Starting Live Streaming**: Setting the user's role to 'host', joining a channel, and then publishing media to that channel.

3. **Channel Media Relay for Multi-channel Streaming**: Setting up source and destination info for channel relaying, initiating the relay, and managing the state of the relay through callbacks.

4. **Joining Multi-channel and Leaving Events**: Handling multiple channels by joining new channels and publishing to them, followed by stopping the media relaying and exiting all joined channels.

Overall, the flowchart provides a structured visualization of the steps a user (and their app) would follow to use a video SDK for creating a live streaming session, including channel management and multi-channel broadcasting.
