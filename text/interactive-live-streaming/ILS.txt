This image is a flowchart diagram illustrating the process involved in using the Agora Video SDK for a video call or broadcast. Here's a breakdown of what each step in the image represents:

1. **Set the client role**: This likely involves configuring the user’s role in the application, such as a host or an audience member.
2. **Retrieve a token**: A token is typically used for authentication to verify the user’s identity before accessing the service.
3. **Join a channel**: Involves connecting to a communication channel where the video or audio broadcast will take place.

Then the diagram splits into two roles:

- **Host**:
  - **Publish local video and audio**: Represents the host broadcasting their video and audio to the audience.

- **Audience**:
  - **Subscribe to video and audio published by the host**: Shows that the audience members receive the video and audio broadcast from the host.

This diagram is useful for understanding the basic flow of operations when using the Agora Video SDK to set up and participate in a video broadcasting session or call, distinguishing between the roles of the host and the audience.
