The image shows a flowchart diagram that illustrates the process flow of hosting and participating in an Interactive Live Streaming (ILS) event through a Video Software Development Kit (SDK) integrated with Agora's SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-time Network). The flowchart includes actions from different actors such as the user, host, and audience, specifying the steps taken from opening the application to cleaning up resources after leaving the streaming event.

Here is a breakdown:

1. **User Flow:**
   - Opens the app.
   - Initiates the Video SDK engine.
   - Starts the video in the engine.
   - Closes the app at the end and cleans up local resources.

2. **Host Flow:**
   - Starts an ILS event; only the hosts broadcast to the channel.
   - Starts local video.
   - Joins the channel.
   - Sends a data stream to the channel.

3. **Audience Flow:**
   - Joins the ILS event.
   - Views the broadcast made by channel hosts.
   - Joins the channel.
   - Retrieves streaming from the host.
   - Receives data streams.
   - Stops local video and leaves the channel when the event ends.

The diagram indicates the interaction between the actors and the Agora SDK during a streaming session, focusing on the role of each participant and the systemic flow of data and control commands.
