This image is a flowchart detailing the process involved in using a video SDK (Software Development Kit) for a live streaming event. The steps are broken down for both the host and the audience within the app, showcasing how they interact with the Agora Video SDK and the SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network). The sequence includes initiating the video SDK, enabling video modules, setting channel profiles, authenticating, setting user roles, initializing video setups for local and remote viewing, streaming data, and finally, cleaning up resources when the user exits the application. Each step is clearly laid out, indicating the flow of actions and interactions necessary for successful live streaming.
