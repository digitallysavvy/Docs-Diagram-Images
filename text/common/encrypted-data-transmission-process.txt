This image is a diagram illustrating a secure data transmission system using encryption. It is labeled with the "Agora SD-RTN™," which implies a proprietary, secure real-time network developed by Agora. Here are the key components and flow of data as depicted:

1. **Client A and Client B:**
   - These represent two separate users or devices engaging in encrypted communication.

2. **Apps A and B:**
   - Each client has an application, which processes data and incorporates encryption mechanisms.

3. **SDK A and SDK B:**
   - Software Development Kits embedded in each application, providing functionalities that include built-in encryption of data before transmission.

4. **Customized Encryption:**
   - Both clients use a layer of customized encryption, possibly tailored to meet specific security requirements, outside of the built-in encryption provided by the SDKs.

5. **Audio/Video Encoding and Decoding:**
   - Handling multimedia data, these processes involve preparing audio/video for transmission (encoding) and converting received data back into playable formats (decoding and rendering).

6. **Agora SD-RTN™:**
   - The cloud symbol represents the network architecture used by Agora for secure and real-time data communication. This network facilitates the encrypted data transmission between clients.

7. **Encryption Data Upstream and Downstream Transmission:**
   - Illustrates the flow of encrypted data from Client A to Client B (upstream) and from Client B to Client A (downstream), all handled securely via Agora's network.

8. **Encrypted Data:**
   - Points within the diagram where data is encrypted and transmitted securely, emphasizing the protection of data at every step of the communication process.

The overall scheme underscores the importance of encryption in maintaining the confidentiality and security of communications, particularly in handling sensitive audio and video content.
