This image is a diagram illustrating the communication architecture using Agora's SD-RTN™ technology. It shows how their Real-Time Communication (RTC) Software Development Kit (SDK) connects with different users within various channels. The diagram includes:

1. **RTC SDK**: Represented as a gray column on the left, indicating the base technology connecting the system.
2. **Voice/Video Call Channel**:
   - **User A: Host** - Publishes audio and video, and subscribes to User B's stream.
   - **User B: Audience** - Publishes audio and video, and subscribes to User A's stream.
3. **Live Video Channel**:
   - **User C: Host** - Publishes audio and video and subscribes to other hosts.
   - **User D: Audience** - Subscribes to all hosts.
4. **Connection Lines**: Showing the flow of information between the RTC SDK and the users, and between the users themselves.
5. **Agora SD-RTN™**: This is shown on a blue column on the right, likely representing the server-side or cloud infrastructure supporting the technology.

Overall, this diagram serves to explain how Agora’s SD-RTN™ facilitates various forms of real-time video and audio communication, enabling both hosts and audiences to interact with minimal latency.
