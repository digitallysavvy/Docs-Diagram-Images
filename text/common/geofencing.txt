The image displays a workflow diagram demonstrating the interaction between a user, an application (App), and the Agora SD-RTN system. It outlines the sequence of actions from starting the app by a user to connecting and joining a channel within the Agora SD-RTN, a specific region for restricted area access. Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. **Start the app**: The user initiates action by starting the application.
2. **Restrict area access**:
    - **Set SD-RTN region in the Agora engine configuration**: The configuration settings for the SD-RTN region are defined.
    - **Initiate the Agora engine**: The engine, presumably underlying software support for real-time applications, is started.
    - **Connect to SD-RTN in a specific region**: The app connects to the specified SD-RTN region.
    - **Success response**: Once the connection is successful, a success response is received.
3. **Select a channel to join**: Following this, the user selects a channel he/she wishes to join.
4. **Join a channel with user ID, channel name, and token**: The user attempts to join a chosen channel using their user ID, the channel name, and a token (possibly for authentication).
5. **Join accepted**: The process concludes when the join request is accepted, indicating that the user successfully joins the channel.

This flow chart effectively illustrates the app user's route through the system to gain access and actively participate in specific channels within the Agora SD-RTN service.
