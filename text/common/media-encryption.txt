The image is a diagram illustrating a secure media stream transmission system, specifically utilizing the services of Agora's SD-RTN™ (Software Defined Real-Time Network). Here’s a breakdown of the components and the process depicted in the diagram:

1. **Client A and Client B**:
   - Each client has an application (App A and App B) and a corresponding SDK (SDK A and SDK B). These clients are involved in capturing, encoding, rendering, and transmitting audio/video data.

2. **Audio/Video Capture and Encoding/Rendering**:
   - At both Client A and Client B, audio and video are captured and either encoded or rendered. This is managed within their respective SDKs.

3. **Encryption and Transmission**:
   - Audio and video streams captured and processed by Client A’s SDK are encrypted using a set method (DLTS for media stream and HTTPS/WSS for encryption method and secret key) and transmitted to an edge server.
   
4. **Edge Server A and Edge Server B**:
   - Edge Server A receives the encrypted media stream from Client A, continues to ensure its security, and then transmits this stream to Edge Server B, possibly via encrypted data transmission (as shown by the cloud and arrows).
   - Edge Server B receives the encrypted media stream, decrypts it, and transmits it to Client B.

5. **Receiving and Decoding at Client B**:
   - The SDK at Client B receives the decrypted media stream. The stream is rendered for playback or further use within App B.

The diagram emphasizes security aspects, showcasing encryption at multiple stages: media stream encryption by the SDKs, transmission encryption between the SDKs and edge servers, and overall data transmission encryption through the network. Agora’s SD-RTN™ appears to play a crucial role in managing and facilitating the secure, real-time transmission and processing of multimedia data streams across the network.
