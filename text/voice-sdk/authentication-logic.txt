This image appears to depict a flowchart outlining the process of joining and renewing a token for channel authentication in an application system. The flowchart is divided into three main sections, indicating responsibilities and roles:

1. **Implemented by you (Token Server)**:
   - **Join a channel with authentication**: It includes actions like requesting a token using channel name, role, token type, and user ID, validating the user against internal security, and generating a token to return to the client.
   - **Renew token**: Under this heading, it involves requesting a fresh token with the mentioned parameters, validating user request against internal logic, and generating and returning a fresh token to the client.

2. **App**:
   - Acts as the intermediary in both joining the channel and renewing the token by handling the communication between the token server and the SD-RTN, adjusting actions based on token validity and expiration events.

3. **Provided by Agora (SD-RTN)**:
   - **Join a channel with uid, channel name, and token**: This process includes joining the channel using the provided user id (uid), channel name, and validated token.
   - **Validate the token**: Ensuring the token provided by the client matches security and access requirements.
   - Notifies the app when the token privileges are about to expire, needing a renewal.

The flow outlined demonstrates how these systems work together to manage secure access to a channel through identity validation and token management.
