The image shows a flowchart representing the process interaction between a user, an application using a Voice SDK, and a service referred to as "Agora SD-RTN." The chart details various functions and procedures within a typical software system setup for handling voice communications.

Here are the key stages depicted:

1. **Open App**: The user opens the application which utilizes the Voice SDK to interact with the Agora Engine (part of Agora SD-RTN).

2. **Voice SDK Operations**: Includes creating and playing a local audio track and handling cases where autoplay might be blocked.

3. **Join**:
   - **Join a channel**: Involves retrieving an authentication token and then joining a communication channel.
   - **Join the channel**: Specifically commands within the SDK to initiate channel join.

4. **Publish and Subscribe**:
   - **Publish the microphone track**: Send the user's audio to the channel.
   - **Subscribe to tracks from other users**: Receive audio from other users.
   - **Manage local and remote audio tracks**: Includes operational management like volume control and muting/unmuting.

5. **Common Workflows**:
   - **Adjust volume**, **Mute/Unmute audio**: User-side audio controls.
   - **Unpublish the local audio track**: Stop sending user's audio to the channel.
   - **Leave the channel**: Procedures to exit from the communication channel.

This flowchart is useful for developers integrating voice capabilities into their apps using Agora's software development kits and services. The "Agora" service mentioned probably refers to a real-time communication platform enabling features like voice and video calls.
