This image shows a flowchart detailing the process for a user to join a channel with authentication, using an app integrated with an Agora authentication token system.

Here is a breakdown of the process shown in the diagram:

1. **User**: The process starts with the user operating the app.
   
2. **App Operations**:
   - **Start the app**: The user initiates the app.
   - **Select a channel**: The user selects a desired channel within the app to join.
   
3. **Authentication and Token Generation**:
   - The app interacts with the developer’s authentication system, where the user must log in to the identity management system.
   - Then, a request for an Agora authentication token is made by the app, using parameters like channel name, user role, token type, and user ID.
   - This request is sent to the developer’s authentication system.
   
4. **Developer's Authentication System**: 
   - The system validates the user’s request against its internal security measures.
   - Using an integrated Agora library, a token is generated and returned to the app (client).

5. **Token Usage**:
   - With the received token, the user then joins the selected channel using their user ID, channel name, and the newly acquired token.
   
6. **Token Validation**: 
   - The SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network) provided by Agora validates the token.
   
7. **Final Stage**:
   - Once the user is successfully added to the channel, a callback is triggered to finalize the joining process.

The diagram clearly categorizes responsibilities into those "Implemented by you" (on the left) involving direct interactions with the user and handling the interface, and those "Provided by Agora" (on the right) dealing with backend processes like token validation and internal security.
