The image displays a flowchart representing the process involved in using a voice SDK with the Agora voice SDK engine for handling voice calls within an application. Here's a breakdown of the steps illustrated in the diagram:

1. **User Interaction:**
   - A user interacts with the app, initiating the SDK by opening the app.

2. **Voice SDK Operations:**
   - The app initializes the Agora Voice SDK engine (`createAgoraRtcEngine()`).
   - Registers the event handler using (`agoraEngine.registerEventHandler`).

3. **SD-RTN Connections:**
   - Setting up client roles through `agoraEngine.setClientRole`.
   - Setting up the channel profile via `agoraEngine.setChannelProfile`.
   - Retrieving authentication token to be used for joining the channel.

4. **Voice Call Execution:**
   - The user joins a channel with obtained authentication token using `agoraEngine.joinChannel`.
   - It captures when a remote user joins the session through an event handler (`RtcEngineEventHandler onUserJoined`).
   - The data streams are sent and received during the session.

5. **Ending the Call:**
   - The user leaves the channel with `agoraEngine.leaveChannel()` command.
   - The user finally closes the application.

Each of these steps is critical in establishing, maintaining, and terminating a voice communication session using this specific SDK within an interactive application environment, managing connections between the userâ€™s app, the voice SDK itself, and the backend infrastructure of Agora (depicted as SD-RTN).
