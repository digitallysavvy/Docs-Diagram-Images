This image is a flowchart describing the process sequence involved when using a Voice SDK with the Agora Engine. The flow includes various stages of user interaction and system responses, as detailed below:

1. **Open App** - The user starts the application.
2. **Create an instance of Agora Engine using Voice SDK** - The application uses the Voice SDK to initialize an Agora Engine instance.
3. **Setup raw data processing** - This includes setting up an audio frame observer for handling audio frames.
4. **Join a channel** - The process involves:
    - Registering the audio frame observer.
    - Setting audio frame parameters.
    - Retrieving an authentication token.
    - Joining a communication channel.
5. **Process raw audio data** - This involves:
    - Getting the raw data in callbacks.
    - Sending processed data back through callbacks.
6. **Leave the channel** - This includes:
    - Unregistering the audio frame observer.
    - Exiting the communication channel.

The flow also details interaction with the SD-RTN component which likely relates to network data handling as part of the audio transmission and reception process. The chart incorporates user and system actions, denoted within blue and white rectangles, respectively.
