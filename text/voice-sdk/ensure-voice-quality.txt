The image depicts a flowchart representing the use of a Voice SDK (Software Development Kit) integrated with your mobile or web application. Here’s a breakdown of the sequence of operations depicted:

1. **Set log file configuration and create engine**:
   - Parameters setting for log files.
   - Creating an instance of the Agora Engine using the Voice SDK.

2. **Pre-call tests**:
   - *Echo Test*: To test hardware and network quality by sending and receiving audio back after a delay.
   - *Network Probe Test*: Starting a network evaluation to measure and deliver network quality scores and statistics.

3. **Join Channel Process**:
   - Setting the audio profile based on the app’s nature, specifying audio parameters and usage scenarios.
   - Joining a communication channel.

4. **Monitor in-call quality**:
   - Enabling and receiving statistics for network, call, and audio quality.
   - Receiving notifications about state changes.
   - Taking corrective actions if necessary to enhance call quality.

5. **Echo cancellation**:
   - Selecting an audio file and specifying mixing options.
   - Starting audio mixing and utilizing echo-cancellation features to improve audio clarity.

This flowchart outlines important steps involved in setting up and managing audio interactions using the Voice SDK, ensuring quality communication by configuring audio settings, testing network conditions, actively monitoring in-call performance, and addressing audio issues like echo.
