This image is a flowchart representing the interaction process between a user, an app, and SD-RTN, which seems to be a network service provided by Agora. Here's a breakdown of the process depicted:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user starts the application, which is represented by the action "Start the app".
   - Later, the user selects a channel to join, which triggers further actions within the app.

2. **App Responsibilities** ("Implemented by you"):
   - Once the app is started by the user, it initiates a series of interactions with the SD-RTN via geofencing.
   - The app sets the SD-RTN region in the Agora engine configuration.
   - It then initiates the Agora engine.
   - The app connects to SD-RTN in a specific region, and upon success, the app receives a positive (success) response.
   - After selecting a channel, the app processes the user ID, channel name, and token to join a channel. The channel join is then accepted.

3. **SD-RTN Responsibilities** ("Provided by Agora"):
   - This service responds to the connection requests and channel joins initiated by the app.

The flowchart uses simple icons and labels to represent the user, the app, and interactions with the SD-RTN service, highlighting the division of responsibilities and the sequence of operations for connecting to a network service and joining a channel. The diagram is likely used for technical documentation or development process mapping.
