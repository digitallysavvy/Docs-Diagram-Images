This image displays a flowchart detailing an audio calling process using the Agora Voice SDK. The flowchart outlines the steps an application follows to implement an audio calling feature:

1. **Opening the App**: The user initiates interaction with the application.

2. **Creating an Agora Voice SDK Engine Instance**: The application creates an instance of the Agora RTC (Real-Time Communication) Engine.

3. **Setting the Context**: The app sets the context with specific parameters like app ID, channel profile (here set to live broadcasting), and an audio scenario.

4. **Initializing the RTC Engine**: The RTC Engine is then initialized with the specified context.

5. **Starting the Call**:
   - **Enabling the Audio**: The audio module is enabled within the RTC Engine.
   - **Setting the User Role**: The user role is set as a broadcaster.
   - **Joining the Channel**: The engine joins a communication channel.

6. **Leaving the Call**: The user or the application initiates leaving the channel, which involves calling the 'LeaveChannel' method.

7. **Closing the App**:
   - **Disabling the Audio Modules**: The audio module of the RTC Engine is disabled before the app closes.

The arrows and lines represent the sequential flow of actions, where control moves back and forth between the user interface and the Agora services (represented on the right side as 'Agora' with 'SD-RTN', likely referring to a service delivery real-time network). The visual design helps clarify the logical steps involved in processing voice calls through an app using the Agora SDK, which is crucial for developers and engineers implementing this feature.
