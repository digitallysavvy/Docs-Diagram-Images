The image displays a sequence diagram, which is used to depict the interaction between a user, your application integrated with a Voice SDK, and the Agora backend via the SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network). Here's a breakdown of the flow shown in the diagram:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user opens your app.
   - The user starts a call.

2. **Your App and Voice SDK**:
   - Your app creates an instance of the Voice SDK engine using `agoraEngine.createAgoraRtcEngine`.
   - Initializes the engine with `agoraEngine.initialize`.
   - Retrieves an authentication token to join a voice channel.

3. **Communication with Agora**:
   - Your app using the Voice SDK sends a request to join a channel via `agoraEngine.joinChannel`.
   - The channel join is accepted by Agora.
   - Audio stream is received and sent during the call.
   - Upon ending the call, your app directs the Voice SDK to leave the channel using `agoraEngine.leaveChannel`.

4. **End of Call**:
   - The user leaves the call.

This flow illustrates how voice communication is initiated and managed within an app using the Agora Voice SDK, highlighting the steps from opening the app to ending a call.
