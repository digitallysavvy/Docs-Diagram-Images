This image outlines the sequence diagram for a voice communication system using the Agora Voice SDK. Here's a step-by-step summary of what the diagram represents:

1. **User Opens the App**: The user initiates the voice communication app.
2. **Your App**: The application logic includes the Voice SDK.
3. **Voice SDK**: This component is responsible for handling voice operations.
4. **Initiate the Agora Voice SDK engine**: The RtcEngine.create method is called to start the Agora Voice SDK engine.
5. **SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network)**: This is the network infrastructure provided by Agora for real-time voice communication.

When the user decides to join a call:
6. **Retrieve Authentication Token**: The user's application requests an authentication token to join a voice channel.
7. **Join the Channel**: The agoraEngine.joinChannel() method is invoked with the retrieved token to connect the user to the channel.
8. **Remote User Joined**: The onUserJoined() callback is triggered when a remote user joins the same channel, indicating successful connection.

When leaving a call:
9. **Leave the Channel**: The user leaves the voice channel by calling agoraEngine.leaveChannel().
10. **Close the App**: After leaving the voice channel, the user decides to close the app.
11. **Clean up Local Resources**: The agoraEngine.destroy() method is called to cleanup resources utilized by the SDK.

This sequence diagram effectively communicates the flow of operations involved in using the Agora Voice SDK for establishing and managing voice calls within an application.
