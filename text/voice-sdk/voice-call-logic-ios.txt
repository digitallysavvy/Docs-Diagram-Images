The image illustrates the sequence diagram for a video calling process using a software development kit (SDK) provided by Agora. The diagram indicates the steps involved from a user's perspective in initiating and participating in a video call through an application integrated with the Agora SDK.

1. **User Interaction**: The process begins with the user opening the app and starting a call.

2. **Agora SDK Initialization**: 
   - The app initializes the Agora SDK engine using `AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine`.
   - The user’s role in the call is set as a broadcaster via `agoraEngine.setClientRole(broadcaster)`.

3. **Connection to the Channel**:
   - The user joins the channel with `agoraEngine?.joinChannel`.
   - The flow indicates that the user then receives notifications of other users joining the channel.

4. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data streams are received and sent during the call, suggesting active communication between users.

5. **Termination of Call**:
   - The user leaves the call and channel with `agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)`.
   - The application cleans up local resources with `AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()`.

6. **Closure of Application**: The user closes the application following the termination of the call.

The diagram also visually caters to the flow between the user’s app, the video SDK, and Agora’s SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network), highlighting how these components interact throughout a call session. This sequence diagram serves as a useful blueprint for developers working on applications involving Agora's video SDK, providing a clear step-by-step guide on handling video calls.
