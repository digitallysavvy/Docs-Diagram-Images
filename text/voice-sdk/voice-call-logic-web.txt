The image shows a flowchart detailing the process of audio communication using the Agora Voice SDK within an application. The process includes the following steps:

1. **User Opens the App** - This initiates the Voice SDK engine by creating a client with the `AgoraRTC.createClient` command.

2. **Setting Event Listeners** - The application sets listeners for the events `user-published` and `user-unpublished` to handle users entering and leaving the audio channel.

3. **User Starts a Call** - The user initiates a call which involves several steps:
   - Retrieving an authentication token to join a channel.
   - The command `agoraEngine.join` is used for the user to enter a specific channel.
   - Once joined, the user creates an audio track (`AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack`).
   - The local audio track is published to the channel using `agoraEngine.publish`.

4. **Handling Streaming** - The application retrieves streaming audio from other users with the event listener `agoraEngine.on("user-published")` and plays the audio using the command `remoteAudioTrack.play`.

5. **Data Streams** - The application is capable of receiving and sending data streams aside from audio.

6. **User Leaves the Call** - To exit the call, the user uses `agoraEngine.leave` to leave the channel and terminate the connection.

Overall, the diagram represents the lifecycle of a voice call facilitated by the Agora SDK, showing both the interactions between the user and the SDK and within the SDK's components itself. Agora's system (SD-RTN) stands external, representing the infrastructure supporting real-time communications.
