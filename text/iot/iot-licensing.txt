This image is a flowchart diagram that outlines the process for managing a license with an IoT (Internet of Things) device. The flow involves interactions between the user, the IoT device, and Agora, a company providing the required services or platform.

Here are the steps detailed in this diagram:

1. **Contact Agora Sales to Request a License:** The user initiates contact with the Agora sales team.
2. **Send License Information:** The requested information about the license is sent back to the user.
3. **Activate the License:** Using the provided information, the user activates the license.
4. **Send Activation Info:** Once the license is activated, that activation info is sent back.
5. **Write a License to the Device:** Finally, the license is written to the IoT device itself.

There are three main columns indicating different entities or components:
- **You:** This is the user interacting with the system.
- **Your IoT Device:** Displays the internal workings of the IoT device, indicated here by "IoT SDK."
- **Agora:** This column is split into "Agora Sales" and "REST API," showing the components of Agora that interact with the user and the IoT device.

Lines and arrows between the steps show the direction of communication and action. This chart is useful for understanding the steps required to license and activate software in the realm of IoT using Agora's services.
