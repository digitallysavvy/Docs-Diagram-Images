The image you provided is a flowchart diagram illustrating the interaction process between a user, a web server, an application (App), and a service called SD-RTN (which appears to be provided by a company named Agora). This flowchart describes a sequence of actions and notifications that occur as part of operations such as login, channel management, and logout within a web-based application framework. Here's a breakdown of the steps displayed in the diagram:

1. **Login Process:**
   - The user initiates the login process which interacts with the Web Server and the App.
   - The App sends a login authentication request to the SD-RTN, which does not generate a notification at this stage.

2. **Channel Management:**
   - After successful login, the user (through the App) sends a request to create a channel.
   - The App then sends a request to SD-RTN to create and open the channel.
   - SD-RTN sends a notification back to the App (Notification 101) indicating the channel name and the time it was opened.
   - The App authenticates this notification.

3. **Channel Operation Acknowledgment:**
   - The system sends a status of "200 OK" (which generally means that the request has been successfully processed) back to the App, indicating that notifications have been sent and acknowledged for all channel events.

4. **Channel Closure:**
   - When the channel needs to be closed, the App sends a request to close the channel.
   - The App then receives a notification (Notification 102) from SD-RTN about the destruction of the channel, including the channel name and the time it was destroyed.
   - After authenticating the notification, the App receives another "200 OK" status.

5. **Logout Process:**
   - Finally, the user logs out through the Web Server and the App.
   - SD-RTN is informed about the logout, resulting in no notification being produced at the end of the process.

This flowchart is useful for understanding how a user interacts with a system through a web server and an application involving steps like authentication, channel creation and management, notification handling, and session termination.
