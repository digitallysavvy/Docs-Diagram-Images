This image represents a flowchart detailing the process of integrating and using a Video SDK (Software Development Kit) within an app, specifically using the Agora Video SDK. Here are the key components illustrated in the diagram:

1. **User and Host Interaction**: Indicates the flow starting from a user opening an app, through starting a video call as a host, to leaving the call and closing the app.

2. **Initiation of Video SDK**: The Video SDK is initiated through the AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine, which likely sets up the overall environment for video calls.

3. **Function Calls and Processes**:
   - **Setting up Local Video Stream**: `agoraEngine.enableVideo()`
   - **Defining User Role in the Call**: `agoraEngine.setClientRole(.broadcaster)`, which likely sets the user as a broadcaster so they can send their video stream.
   - **Managing Local and Remote Videos**: Calls such as `agoraEngine.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)` for local video and `agoraEngine.setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)` for receiving video from other users.
   - **Joining and Leaving the Channel**: Using `agoraEngine.joinChannel` to enter a video call, and `agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)` to exit.

4. **End of Session Clean-up**: The process of cleaning up local resources with `AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()` upon closing the application.

5. **Data Flow Directions**: The direction of flow for data when setting up, during, and ending a call, shown with blue arrows between the user and host.

This diagram explains the interaction between the client (user/host) side of an application and the Agora Video SDK for conducting video calls, showing both the setup and teardown processes along with real-time streaming management.
