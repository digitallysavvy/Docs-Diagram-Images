The image depicts a flowchart that outlines the process steps for a user interacting with an app that utilizes the Agora Video SDK for video communication. Here's the breakdown of the flow:

1. **Your App and User**: From the user opening the app to interacting with integrated video functionalities.
   - **Open App**: The user opens the application.
   - **Video SDK**: This column shows internal app actions using the Agora Video SDK.
   - **Agora**: This column shows interactions with Agora's SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network).

2. **Steps in the App**:
   - **Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine**: Creates an RTC engine using `RtcEngine.create`.
   - **Setup the local video stream**: Activates video functionality using `agoraEngine.enableVideo`.
   - **Widget = RtcLocalView.SurfaceView()**: Initializes a widget for the local video view.

3. **Join a Call by User**:
   - **Retrieve authentication token to join channel**: The app gets a token for channel access.
   - **Join the channel**: The user joins a communication channel using `agoraEngine.joinChannel`.
   - **Retrieve streaming from the other user**: Opens a remote video view using `RtcRemoteView.SurfaceView()`.
   - **Receive and send data stream**: The call facilitates a two-way data stream between users.

4. **Leave Call and Close App**:
   - **Leave the channel**: The user exits the video channel using `agoraEngine.leaveChannel`.
   - **Clean up local resources**: Resources are freed, and the engine is destroyed using `agoraEngine.destroy()`.

From start to finish, this flowchart neatly outlines how a video call is managed using the Agora SDK, including the setup of video resources, joining and leaving the communication channel, and cleanup processes. The flow is representative of typical interactions in apps that offer real-time video communication features.
