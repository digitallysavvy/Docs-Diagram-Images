This image depicts a flowchart representing the process involved when a user interacts with a video software development kit (SDK), likely for a video conferencing or streaming application. The chart outlines several main processes:

1. **Opening the App**: The user starts by opening the application on their device.

2. **Creation and Configuration**: An instance of the Agora Engine is created using the video SDK. This involves enabling both audio and video capabilities within the Agora Engine.

3. **Setup of Raw Data Processing**: This includes setting up the audio frame observer and the video frame observer to handle raw data input.

4. **Joining a Channel**: The user joins a communication channel where they register the video and audio frame observers, set the audio frame parameters, retrieve an authentication token, and formally join the channel.
  
5. **Processing Raw Audio and Video Data**: Raw audio and video data are processed, involving retrieving data in callbacks and sending processed data back via the same callbacks.

6. **Leaving the Channel**: The procedure concludes with the user leaving the channel, unregistering the video and audio frame observers, and then exiting the channel.

7. **Closure**: The user exits the Video SDK post the session.

This sequence of operations typically is used in the development of apps requiring real-time audio and video communication, ensuring each component involved in the audio and video processing is properly initialized, executed, and terminated.
