The image depicts a flow diagram for a video call process using a software development kit (SDK) integrated with the Agora platform (notably its SD-RTN, or Software-Defined Real-Time Network). This diagram outlines the sequential steps and interactions between a user, host, and the network during a video call session, including critical actions such as opening the app, initiating the video SDK, joining a call, managing video streams, and finally cleaning up resources after ending the call. This kind of diagram is commonly used in software development and engineering to map out the functionality and workflow of an application.
