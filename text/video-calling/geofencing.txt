This image depicts a flowchart for a user interacting with an application that utilizes a service called SD-RTN, provided by Agora. The flowchart outlines the sequence of steps and interactions between the user, the application, and the SD-RTN system. Here's a breakdown of the process illustrated:

1. **User Actions:**
   - **Start the app:** The user initiates the application.
   - **Select a channel to join:** After starting the app, the user chooses a communication or service channel within the app.

2. **App Processes:**
   - **Geofencing:**
     - **Set SD-RTN region in the Agora engine configuration:** The application sets the appropriate region for the SD-RTN, likely based on the user's location or specified parameters.
     - **Initiate the Agora engine:** The application starts the Agora engine, which manages the realtime network services.
     - **Connect to SD-RTN in a specific region:** Establishes a connection to the SD-RTN for the defined region.
     - **Success response:** The app receives a success response from the SD-RTN, confirming the connection.
   - **Join a channel with user Id, channel name, and token:** After the initial setup and successful connection, the user can join a chosen channel using their ID, the name of the channel, and a security token.
   - **Join accepted:** The SD-RTN accepts the join request, allowing the user to participate in the channel.

3. **Divisions:**
   - **Implemented by you:** The areas of the app that require your input or development.
   - **Provided by Agora:** Services or components handled by the Agora platform, specifically the SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network).

This flowchart is useful for developers integrating Agora's SD-RTN services into their applications, providing a visual guide to the required steps for setting up and managing user interactions within the app.
