The image you provided is a flowchart describing the process of using a Video SDK (Software Development Kit) with the Agora platform for video communication. Here's a breakdown of the steps illustrated in the flowchart:

1. **User and Your app**: The user interacts with an application that incorporates the Agora Video SDK.
   
2. **Open App**: The process begins when the user opens the app.

3. **Initiate the Video SDK engine**: `AgoraRTC.createClient` is called to create a client for handling the video communication.

4. **Set the required event listeners**: Event listeners for user actions, such as `user-published` and `user-unpublished`, are set up.

5. **Start call**: This signifies the user initiating a video call through the app.

6. **Retrieve authentication token to join channel**: Before joining a video call channel, the user retrieves an authentication token.

7. **Join a channel**: The user joins a channel using `agoraEngine.join`.

8. **Join accepted**: Confirmation that the user has successfully joined the channel.

9. **Create local media tracks**: The SDK creates audio and video tracks from the user’s microphone and camera using `AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack` and `AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack`.

10. **Push local media tracks to the channel**: The local media tracks are published to the channel using `agoraEngine.publish`.

11. **Retrieve streaming from the other user**: The app retrieves streaming media from another user through `agoraEngine.on("user-published")`.

12. **Play remote media tracks**: The system plays the remote audio and video tracks.

13. **Leave call**: The user decides to end the call and leaves the channel using `agoraEngine.leave`.

14. **SD-RTN**: This is likely referring to some type of network or infrastructure support for the Agora platform, though it’s not explicitly explained in the diagram.

Overall, the flowchart is detailing how a user through a specific app interfaced with Agora’s Video SDK can manage and handle video calling functionalities from initializing the SDK to joining and leaving the calls.
