This image is a flowchart illustrating the process involved in setting up and utilising media stream encryption in an application, partially implemented by the user and supported by a service provided by Agora. Here's a breakdown of the depicted steps and components:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user starts the application.

2. **Authentication System** (Implemented by you):
   - The user logs into the authentication system through the app.
   - The system retrieves a 32-byte encryption key and a Base64 formatted 32-byte salt.

3. **Encryption Setup**:
   - The app creates an encryption configuration using the retrieved key and salt.
   - The app then sets this encryption configuration.

4. **Signaling**:
   - The app initiates the signaling engine.

5. **Channel Selection**:
   - The user selects a channel to join in the app.
   - The app retrieves an access token for channel access.

6. **Communication**:
   - The user joins the channel and can now communicate over an encrypted data stream.

7. **Provided by Agora**:
   - SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network), which likely handles the data streaming and encryption services.

The diagram delineates responsibilities ("Implemented by you" vs. "Provided by Agora"), indicating collaboration between the user-implemented systems and Agora's services to ensure secure communication.
