This image presents a flowchart that details the interaction sequence between a user, an application (Your app), and operational procedures involving a Signaling SDK within a signaling system labeled "Agora." The diagram systematically traces how features are implemented and managed, including initiating the SDK, user and channel metadata operations, and the proper steps for closing the signaling session.

Here are the main components and functions:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Opening the app.
   - Creating a Signaling client and events.
   - Creating and setting up a signaling channel.
   - Logging in to signaling and joining a channel.

2. **Usage within User and Channel Context**:
   - Reading and writing user metadata (change user information, subscribe, retrieve).
   - Reading and writing channel metadata (set channel metadata, retrieve metadata).

3. **Using Locks**:
   - Setting locks to update channel metadata with locking features.
   - Acquiring and specifying locks.
   - Releasing locks.

4. **Closing Operations**:
   - User exiting the channel.
   - Unsubscribing from metadata updates.
   - Logging out of the Signaling system.

This schema is likely a guide for developers integrating the signaling processes into an application using Agora's SDK. It provides a structured outline to handle signaling in a networked communication application.
