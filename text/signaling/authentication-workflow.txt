This image depicts a flowchart outlining the processes involving a token server, your app, and the Agora signaling system for handling real-time messaging (RTM) and real-time communication (RTC) tokens. The processes covered include logging into signaling with authentication, initiating a signaling engine, joining a stream channel, and renewing tokens. Each step shows the interaction sequence between different components of the system, and the directional flow arrows indicate the order and communication paths for requests and responses in this security and communication protocol management.
