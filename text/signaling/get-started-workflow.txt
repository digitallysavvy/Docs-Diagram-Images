This image is a sequence diagram that illustrates the process of interaction between a user, a mobile or web application ("Your app"), and a signaling system provided by "Agora." The diagram highlights how the Signaling Software Development Kit (SDK) is used within the application to handle different operations associated with messaging.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each step in the sequence diagram:

1. **Initialize**:
   - The user opens the application.
   - The application creates an instance of the signaling engine.
   - Event listeners are added.
   - An authentication token is set.
   - The application logs in to the signaling system.

2. **Messages**:
   - The application subscribes to a channel using the signaling engine (`signalingEngine.subscribe`).
   - It publishes a message to that channel (`signalingEngine.publish`).
   - The application listens for message events.
   - Once a message is received, it's relayed to the user or the app (`message` event).

3. **Close**:
   - The user logs out.
   - The application logs out of the signaling system.

This kind of diagram is common in software development for planning and documenting system architectures and interactions, particularly for understanding asynchronous operations involving communication systems like real-time messaging.
