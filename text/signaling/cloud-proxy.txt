The image depicts a flowchart illustrating the process involved in setting up and using a cloud-based communication or proxy system, likely for real-time network applications. Here is a detailed breakdown of the components and processes shown:

1. **Entities Involved:**
   - **User:** A generic user of the application.
   - **Admin:** Likely the administrator or someone with higher-level access to the app's settings.
   - **App:** The application that interfaces with the user and admin.
   - **Enterprise Firewall:** Security mechanism to protect the internal network.
   - **Cloud Proxy:** Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
   - **SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network):** Helps in managing the network's data transferring efficiently in real-time.

2. **Procedure:**
   - **Initialization and Proxy Setting:** The admin whitelists IP addresses and ports for the Cloud Proxy in the firewall, after which the app facilitates the initialization of a signaling engine and calls a method to enable a cloud proxy connection.
   - **Proxy Access and Channel Join:**
     - The app requests access to the cloud proxy.
     - The enterprise firewall checks the whitelist to grant access, and the cloud proxy requests access to the SD-RTN.
     - Successful access and proxy information allow the user to join a communication channel.
     - That channel allows the user to send and receive data streams in real-time.
   - **Leave Channel:** Eventually, the user and admin can leave the channel, which involves leaving the communication channel properly.

3. **Flowchart Design:** The flowchart is categorized into columns for clarity, each showing the responsibilities of different components from user actions to backend processes provided by a company named Agora. It lays out a clear sequence of actions and checks that are required to securely and effectively manage data streams within a protected network environment.

This kind of flowchart is commonly used in IT and communications to plan and demonstrate system architectures and workflows, especially to ensure compliance with security protocols and efficient operation.
