The image depicts a workflow diagram for a signaling process using an SDK (Software Development Kit) in an app interacting with a service called Agora. This diagram outlines how a user operates the app using various functions enabled by the SDK related to signaling interactions.

Specifically, the process includes:
1. **Initialization and Authentication**: The user initializes by opening the app, creating an instance of the signaling engine, setting callbacks, and logging into the signaling service using an authentication token.
2. **Channel Operations**: The user can create a stream channel, subscribe to channels, and manage channel events.
3. **Topic Operations**: The user can join topics, subscribe to specific topics, and manage topic events.
4. **Message Handling**: The user can send messages, publish messages to a topic, listen for message events from the topic, and receive messages.
5. **Presence and User Status**: The user can change their status, listen for user-related events, and inform other users of changes.
6. **Closure Operations**: The user can log out from the signaling service.

The workflow shown clearly divides the responsibilities and interactions between the "Your app" side and the "Agora" signaling service side, illustrating the signaling SDK's various functionalities to facilitate real-time communication within an application.
