The image depicts a flowchart for integrating a signaling SDK (Software Development Kit) with an application, specifically for managing real-time, online presence notifications and queries within a communication platform (labelled as "Agora" in the diagram).

Here's a breakdown of the flowchart:

1. **Initialization Phase:**
   - When the app is opened, a signaling engine instance is created.
   - The presence event listener is added, authentication token is set, and the signaling system is logged in.

2. **Presence Notifications:**
   - Upon joining a communication channel, the app subscribes to the channel and enables presence events for it (like a user joining or leaving, or changing their status).
   - When a presence event occurs, it is noted, and the arguments of the event are read to update the app and inform other users.

3. **Presence Queries:**
   - It can load the list of users in a channel using the `getOnlineUsers` method, and retrieve the list of channels a user belongs to with `getUserChannels`.

4. **User Status:**
   - Users can set their own status and query the status of other remote users via `setState` and `getState` methods, respectively.

5. **Closing Operations:**
   - The user logs out of the signaling system when done.

This sequence helps manage user interactions and presence within a digital communication environment efficiently. The flowchart indicates thorough integration steps to ensure user statuses are accurately represented and managed in a channel-based system.
