This image describes the process flow of audio and video data from capture to playback. Here's a breakdown of each step shown in the diagram:

1. **Capture:** This is the first stage where both audio and video data are captured.
2. **Pre-process:** After capturing, the data is pre-processed which typically involves operations such as calibration, noise reduction, and adjusting data formats.
3. **Encode:** The pre-processed data is encoded in this step, which involves compressing the audio and video to make it suitable for transmission, reducing the bandwidth required to send the data.
4. **Transmit:** This step involves the actual sending of the encoded data to another device or service.
5. **Decode:** Once received, the data is decoded - this reverses the encoding process to restore the audio and video to a usable format.
6. **Post-process:** After decoding, the data may undergo further processing such as enhancing image quality, synchronizing audio with video, etc.
7. **Play:** The final step in the process is the playback of the audio and video data.

Additionally, there is an "AI Noise Suppression" feature that specifically processes the audio data to remove unwanted noise. This step interacts with the pre-processing stage to improve the audio quality.
