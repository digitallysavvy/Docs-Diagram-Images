The image depicts a flowchart detailing a system architecture which involves user interaction, web application operation, and integration with external services provided by Agora and ActiveFence. Here's a breakdown of the process as illustrated:

1. **User Interaction**: 
   - The user logs into an application through a web server.
   - The user then joins a channel within the application.

2. **Web Server and App**: 
   - These components, implemented by the user's side, handle the login and channel joining process.

3. **Agora's SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-time Network)**:
   - This service facilitates login authentication and supports joining a channel with ActiveFence activated.

4. **ActiveFence**:
   - ActiveFence comes into play once the channel is joined, where it monitors the content within the channel.
   - If the content matches a predefined workflow risk, an action is triggered via a webhook.

5. **Action on Webhook**: 
   - Depending on the outcome from ActiveFence, a webhook can trigger various automated responses, such as using a REST API to manage the channel (e.g., removing a user from the channel).

6. **Logout Process**: 
   - Post interaction, the user logs out which is handled by the web server and app.

This whole process integrates user management, authentication, content moderation, and response actions effectively by leveraging the capabilities of both Agora and ActiveFence systems.
