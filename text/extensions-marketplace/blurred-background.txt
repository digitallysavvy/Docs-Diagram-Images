1. **Original Background** - This suggests the default or unaltered background state.
2. **Blurred Background** (Users can choose blurring level) - This indicates an option where the background can be blurred, with adjustable levels of blurring.
3. **Image Background** - This suggests a third option where an image can be used as a background.

This graphical layout is typically used in presentations or software settings to demonstrate different background customization options available to a user.
