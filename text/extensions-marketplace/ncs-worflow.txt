This image presents a flowchart illustrating a user interaction and system response process in a network application, involving components implemented by you and components provided by Agora and ActiveFence. Here's what the flowchart depicts:

1. **User Actions:**
   - The user logs in and joins a channel through an application (App) hosted on a web server.

2. **Integration with Agora and ActiveFence:**
   - The login process involves authentication handled by an SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network) provided by Agora.
   - The user then joins a channel where ActiveFence is activated to monitor the content within the channel.

3. **Monitoring and Response:**
   - ActiveFence continuously monitors the content in the channel to identify potential risks.
   - If the content matches a pre-defined workflow risk, an action webhook triggers an alert.

4. **Webhook Actions:**
   - In response to the webhook alert, a prescribed action such as using the Channel Management REST API to remove a user from the channel may be taken.

5. **User Logs Out:**
   - Eventually, the user logs out of the system, which might involve logging out from both the application side and the Agora SD-RTN.

6. **Columns Defined:**
   - The leftmost column describes actions "Implemented by you" such as managing the web server and app functionalities.
   - The middle column shows services "Provided by Agora" such as login authentication and session handling through SD-RTN.
   - The rightmost column involves services "Provided by ActiveFence" for content monitoring and risk management within the channel.

This flowchart is likely designed for developers or system architects to understand the roles of various components in handling user interactions and maintaining security and operational integrity in a communication platform.
