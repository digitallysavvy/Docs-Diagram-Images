This image depicts a network diagram that illustrates the data flow between an Agora SDK and a cloud proxy, passing through an enterprise firewall. The process is divided into four steps:

1. **Request Proxy:** The Agora SDK sends a request to the enterprise firewall to connect with a proxy.
2. **Return Proxy Information:** The enterprise firewall returns proxy configuration information back to the SDK.
3. **Send Data:** Data is sent from the SDK, presumably via the configured proxy settings, towards an intended destination.
4. **Receive Data:** Data is received back at the SDK from the destination via the cloud proxy.

The image also includes representation of two cloud icons labeled "Agora SD-RTNâ„¢" and "Cloud Proxy" indicating two separate components within the network where data is processed or routed.

This overall flow is typical for corporate environments where secure data transfer is handled via proxies to comply with IT security policies.
