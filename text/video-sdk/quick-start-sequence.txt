This image is a flowchart that depicts the processes involved in a video SDK (Software Development Kit) system. It outlines the steps and interactions between two roles: an "App: Host" and "App: Audience".

Here's a brief overview of the depicted processes for both roles:

1. **Initialization of the Engine**:
   - **Host and Audience:** Both start by creating and initializing the engine.

2. **Setting Video Properties**:
   - **Host and Audience:** Both enable the video module and initialize the local view for displaying a local video preview.
   
3. **Joining the Channel**:
   - **Host:** Joins the channel as a host and sets the user role. Then, it notifies the host that the channel has been joined.
   - **Audience:** Joins the channel as an audience member and then is notified that the channel has been successfully joined.
   
4. **Setting Remote View**:
   - **Host:** Sets the remote view.
   - **Audience:** Initializes their remote view to receive audio and video from the host.

5. **Start Audio and Video Interaction**:
   - **Host:** Sends audio and video to the audience.
   - **Audience:** Receives the audio and video.

6. **Ending Audio and Video Interaction**:
   - **Host:** Leaves the channel and notifies the host that it has left.
   - **Audience:** Leaves the channel and receives notification that it has left the channel.

7. **Destroying the Engine**:
   - **Both roles** end by destroying the engine, effectively shutting down operations.

Each of these steps involves interactions with the underlying video SDK, which facilitates the operations required for audio and video streaming between the host and audience. This flowchart is useful for developers to understand the sequence and dependencies involved in implementing these functionalities in a video broadcasting or conferencing app.
