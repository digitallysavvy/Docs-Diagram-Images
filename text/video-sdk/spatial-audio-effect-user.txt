The image is a flow diagram that illustrates the process of updating spatial audio parameters using the Agora SDK in a software application. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components and flow:

1. **Local User**: This represents a user of the application, whose spatial position is being tracked.

2. **Developer server**: A server setup by the application developer that processes and facilitates the exchange of information.

3. **Agora SDK**: The Software Development Kit provided by Agora, which is used to manage spatial audio parameters among other functionalities.

**Flow Steps:**
- **Step 1**: The spatial position of the local user is sent to the developer server.
- **Step 2**: The developer server receives spatial positions of remote users.
- **Step 3**: Based on the positions of both the local and remote users, the application updates the spatial audio parameters through the Agora SDK.

This process helps in creating a more immersive and realistic audio experience in applications, particularly those involving real-time interactions like virtual conferences or gaming environments, where the audio perspective adjusts dynamically according to the user's position relative to others.
