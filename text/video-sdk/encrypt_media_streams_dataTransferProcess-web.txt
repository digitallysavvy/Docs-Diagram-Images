This image is a diagram illustrating the architecture of a secure, encrypted media streaming process involving two users, User A and User B, facilitated by Agora's SD-RTN™ (Software-Defined Real-Time Network). Here’s a breakdown of the components and data flow:

1. **User A and User B**:
   - Each user has an application (App A for User A, App B for User B) integrated with a software development kit (SDK - SDK A for User A, SDK B for User B) designed for audio and video collection and encoding.

2. **Encryption Keys and Transport**:
   - Both users generate encryption transport keys and salts on their servers, which are transmitted securely over HTTPS/WSS (HTTP Secure/WebSocket Secure).

3. **setEncryptionConfig**:
   - This function is presumably called within each app to configure the encryption settings, utilizing the keys and salts established.

4. **Media Stream Encryption and Transport**:
   - Audio and video streams are encrypted using DTLS-SRTP (Datagram Transport Layer Security and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) and sent to the respective edge servers (Edge Server A for User A, Edge Server B for User B).

5. **Edge Servers**:
   - These servers are part of Agora's network, receiving the encrypted media streams from the users. Here, the media streams are decrypted for further processing or routing.

6. **Agora SD-RTN™**:
   - This is depicted at the top, representing the overall network responsible for transporting encrypted media streams between users securely and efficiently.

The overall theme of the diagram emphasizes secure, encrypted transmission of audio and video data in a real-time communication setup, which is critical for privacy and security in applications such as video conferencing or live broadcasting.
