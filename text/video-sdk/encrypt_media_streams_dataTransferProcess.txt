The image shows a diagram representing the encryption process of media streams between two users (User A and User B) using different applications (App A and App B) with accompanying SDKs (SDK A and SDK B). The diagram illustrates secured, encrypted communication between the two users, typically applied in real-time communication platforms.

Here's a breakdown of the process visualized in the diagram:
- Both User A and User B have applications (App A and App B) that integrate SDKs (SDK A for User A and SDK B for User B) to enable encryption.
- There are key functions labeled within each user's environment:
  - **enableEncryption**: This feature is turned on to start the encryption process.
  - **Audio & Video Collection & Encoding**: Media (audio and video) is collected and encoded in the user's device.
  - **Built-in Encryption**: After encoding, the audio and video data is encrypted within the SDK.
  - **Send Encrypted Media Stream**: The encrypted media stream is then sent through a network using TCP/UDP encrypted transmission.
- There's a central component labeled "Agora SD-RTNâ„¢" suggesting the use of Agora's Software Defined Real-Time Network, highlighting transport encryption of media streams. 

Additionally, the diagram also includes a mechanism for generating keys and salts on your server, which are then used for encryption transport between users.

The overall structure is symmetrical, showing similar processes for both users, indicating that the system uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that the media streams are secure throughout transmission from one user to the other.
