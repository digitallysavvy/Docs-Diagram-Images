The image shows a flowchart that details different states and transitions involved in a network or software application's user connection handling process. It likely represents a high-level overview of how a software development kit (SDK) manages user connections for an application. Here's a breakdown of the key elements shown in the flowchart:

1. **Joining a Channel:** 
   - The process starts with "UID 1" and "UID 2" at time "T0", both attempting to join a channel.
   - Upon successfully joining the channel, there is a transition to "OnJoinChannelSuccess", indicating that the user has joined successfully.

2. **Connection State Changes and Interruptions:**
   - "OnConnectionStateChanged" is triggered, indicating a successful network connection (CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_SUCCESS).
   - If there is a network interruption at time "T3", a state change to "OnConnectionStateReconnecting" occurs (CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING, CONNECTION_CHANGED_INTERRUPTED), implying efforts to re-establish the network connection.

3. **Connection Loss and Reconnection:**
   - At "T5", if the network connection is lost, "OnConnectionLost" is triggered.
   - The SDK attempts to automatically reconnect (as indicated by the dashed line going from "SDK automatically reconnects").

4. **Network Connection Failures:**
   - If the reconnection fails (time "T7"), it changes state to "OnConnectionStateChanged" with parameters (CONNECTION_STATE_FAILED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_FAILED), highlighting a failure in the network connection.

5. **User Online and Offline Status:**
   - For "UID 2", at "T2" when the remote user comes online, "OnUserJoined" is triggered.
   - The user eventually goes offline at "T6", as indicated by "OnUserOffline" with a reason of USER_OFFLINE_DROPPED.

The flowchart efficiently visualizes how users enter and interact within a channel, how the system handles connection issues, and outlines both automatic reconnection attempts and user offline scenarios. This can be particularly useful for developers and system administrators managing real-time applications requiring stable network connections, like video conferencing or real-time collaborative platforms.
