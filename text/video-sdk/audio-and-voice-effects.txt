This image is a flowchart diagram depicting how an application, specifically using the Agora Video SDK, interacts with Agora's SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network) to process audio and video functionalities. The flowchart shows the sequence of actions a user can perform through the application, such as:

1. Opening the app and initializing the Agora Engine with audio and video enabled.
2. Joining a communication channel after retrieving an authentication token.
3. Playing and managing audio effects, including triggering, playing, pausing, setting position, and setting volume of the sound effects.
4. Controlling audio mixing, including starting and stopping of the audio mix.
5. Applying voice effects, setting preset voice effects, and disabling the voice effects.
6. Finally, the user leaves the channel.

This kind of diagram is useful for developers to understand how an SDK like Agora's integrates into an app for providing real-time communication services.
