The image you provided is a flowchart diagram that outlines the process of integrating and managing a video SDK within an application. It illustrates numerous steps, starting from creating the Agora engine and setting up the application to joining a channel and monitoring the quality of the service during calls.

Here's a breakdown of the key sections in the flowchart:

1. **Create Agora Engine**:
   - Set log file path, log level, and file size.
   - Create the Agora engine instance.

2. **Best Practice for App Initiation**:
   - Enable dual-stream mode to allow users to select a stream type.
   - Set options for local publishing and remote subscribe fallback.

3. **Settings Check**:
   - Specify audio profile and scenario based on the application's nature.
   - Set the video encoder configuration.
   - Start the network probe test to check connectivity.

4. **Join Channel**:
   - Enable video features.
   - Actually join the channel for communication.

5. **In-call Quality Monitoring**:
   - Enable statistics monitoring for quality assurance.
   - Receive updates on network, call, audio, and video quality statistics.
   - React to state change notifications and take corrective actions if necessary.

6. **User Interaction**:
   - Initially, the user opens the app which uses the Video SDK.
   - Finally, the user is informed about the quality and any issues or notifications during the call.

Overall, the diagram is used to visualize the process of setting up and ensuring the effective functioning of video communications within an application using the Agora SDK and SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network).
