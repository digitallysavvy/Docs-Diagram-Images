This image represents a flowchart detailing the process of interacting with a Video SDK (Software Development Kit) and its integration with an audio handling system via an Agora Engine. Here is how the flow works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The App creates an instance of the Agora Engine.

2. **Registering Audio Observer:**
   - The App requests to register the audio observer with the Video SDK. This step enables the app to handle audio data (like modifying or analyzing incoming audio).

3. **Joining Channel:**
   - The App sends a request to join a communication channel facilitated by the SDK.

4. **Processing Audio Data:**
   - Once in the channel, the App receives raw audio data from the SDK through a registered callback.
   - The App processes this audio data, which could involve modifying it for local playback or for further use within the SDK.
   - The processed audio data is then sent back to the SDK through the registered callback.

5. **Leaving the Channel:**
   - The App unregisters the audio observer, indicating that it no longer needs to receive or process audio data.
   - The App sends a request to leave the channel.
   - The Agora Engine is destroyed, concluding the session.

This flowchart is useful for software developers to understand the sequence of operations needed to implement audio features within an app using the specific Video SDK.
