The image illustrates a flowchart for using a Video SDK within an application, focusing on the interactions between the user's application, the Video SDK, and Agora's services. Below is a detailed description of the steps shown in the image:

1. **Your app Column**:
   - **User Opens the App**: The user initiates the process by opening the app.
   - **Initiate the Video SDK Engine**: The app creates an AgoraRTC client object to initiate the real-time communication engine.
   - **Start Video in the Engine**: Initializes the video functionalities in the engine.
   - **Start Local Media**: Sets up and initializes a local media stream, and then plays it.
   - **Retrieve Authentication Token to Join Channel**: The app retrieves an authentication token needed to join a communication channel.
   - **Join the Channel**: The user joins a communication channel with the retrieved token.
   - **Join Accepted**: The join request is accepted.
   - **Push Local Media to the Channel**: The user's local media stream is published to the channel.
   - **Retrieve Streaming from the Other User**: The app subscribes to other streams added to the channel.
   - **Receive and Send Data Streams**: Exchanges data streams with other participants.
   - **Leave Call**: The user leaves the channel on ending the call.
   
2. **Agora Column**:
   - Actions related to the Software-Defined Real-Time Network (SD-RTN) are referenced, indicating the backend process handled by Agora.

This flowchart is helpful for understanding the typical sequence of operations involving video calls or media streaming within applications using the AgoraRTC SDK.
