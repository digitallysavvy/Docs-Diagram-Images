This image depicts a diagram of the Agora SDK and its interaction with various third-party video capture modules and output channels. The workflow shown in the diagram is as follows:

1. **Video to be captured**: This is the input from various video sources, indicated as "Video to be captured" for each third-party module.
  
2. **Third-party video capture modules 1, 2, ... N**: These modules capture the video inputs. They are labeled as "Third-party video capture module 1", "Third-party video capture module 2", through "Third-party video capture module N", which indicates multiple video sources or inputs.

3. **Captured video frames**: The video frames captured by each third-party video capture module are then forwarded to the Agora SDK, as indicated by the arrows pointing from each capture module to the SDK.

4. **Agora SDK**: The central element in the diagram processes the incoming video frames. It acts as an interface or processor before outputting to different channels.

5. **Custom video track 1, 2, ... N**: The processed video tracks or streams output from the Agora SDK, each corresponding to one of the input modules.

6. **Channel 1, Channel 2, ... N**: Each custom video track is then directed towards its respective channel for further use or broadcasting.

The diagram essentially elaborates the processing and channeling of video data through specific modules and the central SDK in a systematic and multi-channel environment.
