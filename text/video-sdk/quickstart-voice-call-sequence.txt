This image depicts a sequence diagram outlining the interaction between two applications, a host app, and an audience app, both utilizing a Voice SDK. The diagram is divided into several phases:

1. **Initialize the Engine**:
   - Both apps initialize the voice SDK engine.

2. **Join Channel**:
   - The host joins a channel and sets the user role as host, while the audience joins the same channel and sets the user role as audience. 
   - The host and audience are then notified that the channel has been joined.

3. **Start Audio Interaction**:
   - The host app starts to send audio.
   - The audience app receives the audio sent by the host.

4. **End Audio Interaction**:
   - The host leaves the channel, and notifications are sent to both the host and the audience about the channel departure.
   - Afterwards, both the host and the audience destroy the engine, indicating that the interaction and the session have ended.

The flow lines (solid and dashed) indicate the sequence and communication directions between different components. The diagram effectively describes the lifecycle of an audio interaction session between a host and an audience using a voice SDK.
