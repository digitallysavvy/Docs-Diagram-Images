The image is a flowchart that depicts the process of a live streaming event using the Agora Video SDK. It illustrates the interactions between the User, Host, and Audience within an app that integrates the Agora SDK. Here is a detailed breakdown of each step illustrated in the diagram:

1. **User Interactions:**
   - The user opens the app which triggers the Video SDK.
   - Following this, the Agora Video SDK engine is initiated.
   - Audio and video modules are enabled using specified SDK methods.
   - The channel profile is set through the SDK's context settings.

2. **Host Actions:**
   - The host starts a live streaming event.
   - An authentication token is retrieved to join the channel.
   - The host's role is set as a broadcaster.
   - Local video setup is done on the host’s device.
   - The host then joins the channel and begins sending the data stream.

3. **Audience Actions:**
   - The audience members join the live streaming event.
   - They similarly retrieve an authentication token to join the channel.
   - Their role is set as audience members.
   - They join the channel and receive the data stream.
   - Optionally, they can set up to view the host’s stream remotely.

4. **End of Session:**
   - The host and audience leave the live streaming event.
   - They exit by leaving the channel.
   - Finally, they close their apps, and the local resources used by the SDK are released.

This flowchart is comprehensive in showing how the Agora Video SDK can facilitate a live streaming session, handling roles of host and audience, and managing the data streams and channels within an application environment labeled as "Your app" on top.
