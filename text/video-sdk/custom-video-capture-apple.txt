This image illustrates a diagram involving the interaction and workflow among an application (App), a Software Development Kit (SDK), and Agora SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-time Network), likely related to video streaming or video conferencing.

Here's a breakdown of the workflow represented in the diagram:

1. **App**:
   - **Create and initialize the engine**: This is likely the start-up process of the application where the base functionalities of the app are being set up.
   - **Enable the video module**: Activating the video functionalities within the application.
   - *Custom Video Capture*:
      - **Set up the external video source**: Integration of an external camera or other video input.
      - **Join the channel**: Connect to a communication channel for video data exchange.
      - **Send processed video data to SDK**: The processed video is sent from the app to the SDK.
      - **Leave the channel**: The app disconnects from the channel.
      - **Destroy the engine**: Shutting down the core functionalities and resources of the application.

2. **SDK**:
   - The diagram does not specify detailed actions within the SDK, but indicates that it is receiving and sending data to the cloud (Agora SD-RTN) based on requests from the App. 

3. **Agora SD-RTN**:
   - Mainly handles requests to join or leave the channel, which involves managing real-time video streaming to and from the cloud.

The process encapsulates typical steps in setting up, managing, and terminating a video streaming or video conferencing session using a combination of an application, SDK, and cloud networking solutions. The message "You manage video collection and processing on your own" underscores that the application is responsible for the actual collection and processing of video data, which is then interfaced with the SDK.
