This image depicts a flowchart that outlines the interactions and processes between a user's app, a video SDK (Software Development Kit), and Agora's SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real Time Network) for enabling video communications.

Here's a breakdown of the sequence and functionalities depicted in the flowchart:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user opens an app that integrates the video SDK.
   
2. **App Setup with Video SDK**:
   - The video SDK is used to create an instance of the Agora Engine.
   - Audio and video capabilities are enabled in the engine.

3. **Join a Channel**:
   - The user must retrieve an authentication token to join a communication channel.
   - The user then joins the channel.

4. **Publish and Subscribe**:
   - The user publishes camera and microphone streams to the channel.
   - They also subscribe to streams from other users and manage local and remote streams.

5. **Common Workflows**:
   - Features include starting screen sharing, capturing and publishing the screen to the channel, and adjusting or muting the volume through API methods.

6. **Leaving the Channel**:
   - The user disconnects by leaving the channel.

7. **Ending Session**:
   - The user exits the application.
   
The flowchart illustrates the core functionalities offered by video SDKs like Agora, highlighting how they manage real-time audio and video streams within applications.
