This image is a flowchart diagram illustrating the process of a live streaming event using a Video SDK (Software Development Kit), specifically involving Agora's SDK interfaces. Let's go through the depicted workflow:

1. **User and Host Interaction:**
   - The User opens the app.
   - The Host starts a live streaming event.

2. **Video SDK Initialization and Usage:**
   - The Video SDK engine is initiated (`AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine`).
   - Video is enabled within the engine (`agoraEngine.enableVideo()`).

3. **Host Specific Actions:**
   - The host sets their client role to broadcaster (`agoraEngine.setClientRole(broadcaster)`).
   - The host sets up local video (`agoraEngine.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)`).
   - The host then joins the channel (`agoraEngine?.joinChannel`).
   - The host sends data streams.

4. **Audience Interaction:**
   - The audience joins the same live streaming event.
   - The audience sets their client role to viewer (`agoraEngine.setClientRole(audience)`).
   - The audience joins the channel (`agoraEngine?.joinChannel`).
   - The audience retrieves and receives data streams from the host (`agoraEngine.setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)`).

5. **Ending the Session:**
   - The host stops the local video (`agoraEngine.stopPreview()`).
   - Both host and audience leave the channel (`agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)`).

6. **User Closes the App:**
   - The user closes the app.
   - Local resources are cleaned up (`AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()`).

The diagram also includes two parallel dotted lines labeled 'Your app' and 'Video SDK', connecting the User directly to the Agora server operations, illustrating the role and flow within the application structure. The connection marked as 'SD-RTN' seems to denote a type of networking technology or server designation used in the streaming process.
