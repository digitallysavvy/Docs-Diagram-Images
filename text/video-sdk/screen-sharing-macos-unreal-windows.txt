This is a flowchart diagram illustrating the process of screen sharing using an application with a video SDK (Software Development Kit) and a service known as Agora SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network). Here's a breakdown of the steps shown in the flowchart:

1. **App Section**:
   - **Get available screen or window information**: The app requests information about available screens or windows for sharing.
   - **Return available screen or window information**: The information is transmitted back to the app.
   - **Start screen capture**: The app begins capturing the selected screen or window.
   - **Set the screen sharing scene (optional)**: Optionally, specific settings or scenes can be adjusted for the screen sharing.
   - **Join the channel**: The app connects to a communication channel, likely for transmitting the screen share data.
   - **Update the screen sharing area or parameters**: Adjustments can be made to the screen share settings as needed.
   - **Display stroke on the shared screen (optional)**: Optionally, visual annotations or highlights can be added on the shared screen.
   - **Block window (optional)**: Specific windows can be blocked or hidden from being shared.
   - **Stop screen sharing**: Ends the screen sharing process.

2. **Video SDK**:
   - No specific actions are detailed here, but it facilitates the communication between the app and the Agora SD-RTN.

3. **Agora SD-RTN Section**:
   - **Publish the screen-sharing stream in the channel**: The initial screen-sharing data is transmitted through the network.
   - **Publish the updated screen-sharing stream in the channel**: Any updates to the shared screen content are also transmitted.
   - **Stop publishing the screen sharing stream in the channel**: Terminates the publishing of screen share data across the network.

Overall, the image details the systematic interaction between an application, a video SDK, and a networking service to facilitate screen sharing within a digital communication environment.
