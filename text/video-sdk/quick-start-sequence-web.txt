This image is a flowchart outlining the process of using a video SDK (Software Development Kit), specifically for handling video conferencing or streaming functionalities. It breaks down the sequence of operations for a typical real-time communication application, presumably using the Agora SDK given the function names used within the chart.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the process as depicted in the flowchart:

1. **Create a Local Client** - Initializes a new client for real-time communication by setting the mode to 'rtc'. 
    - `AgoraRTC.createClient`
    
2. **Join Channel** - The local client joins a communication channel.
    - `AgoraRTCClient.join`

3. **Create and Publish Local Audio and Video Tracks** - Generates and starts transmission of local audio and video.
    - `AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack`
    - `AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack`
    - `AgoraRTCClient.publish`
    
4. **Subscribe to Remote Users** - The client listens for other users joining and subscribing to their feeds.
    - `client.on("user-published")`
    - `AgoraRTCClient.subscribe`
    - Retrieves remote audio/video objects:
       - `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.audioTrack`
       - `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.videoTrack`
    
5. **Leave the Channel** - A process for leaving the channel which includes turning off local tracks and formally exiting.
    - `MicrophoneAudioTrack.close`
    - `CameraVideoTrack.close`
    - `AgoraRTCClient.leave`

The chart details the interaction between the application layer (App), the video SDK, and the Agora SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network), showing how data flows through the system for processing and transmission of audio and video streams.
