The image depicts a sequence diagram, which is used to represent the interaction between different entities in a system over time. In this particular diagram, the entities involved are the User, an Application (App), and a Software Development Kit (SDK). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the interactions and steps depicted in the sequence diagram:

1. **Request a Device Test**: The User initiates a test through the App.
2. **Start Echo Test**: The App requests the SDK to start an echo test.
3. **Audio Test**:
   - **Speak into the recording device**: The User speaks into a device to test audio recording.
   - **Hear your own voice through the playback device**: The User then hears their voice played back after a default delay of 2 seconds, testing audio playback.
4. **Video Test**:
   - **Enable the camera**: This step initiates a test of the video capturing functionality.
   - **See the camera feed in the app**: The User then views the camera feed in the App to confirm it is functioning.
5. **Request to Stop Testing**: After confirming the audio and video functionality, the User requests to stop the testing.
6. **Stop Echo Test**: The App informs the SDK to stop the echo test and thus concludes the testing sequence.

The gray boxes labelled "Audio test" and "Video test" seem to represent phases or sub-processes within the main testing workflow. Each step is connected by arrows that indicate the direction of communication flow. This diagram is likely used for software development and integration purposes, illustrating how components should interact for device testing.
