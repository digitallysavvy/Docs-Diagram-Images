The image is a flowchart detailing the process of custom audio rendering within a software application. It includes interactions between the App, a Software Development Kit (SDK), and the Agora Software-Defined Real-Time Network (SD-RTN). Here are the steps outlined in the flowchart:

1. **Create and Initialize the Engine**: The application initializes the engine via the SDK.

2. **Turn on Custom Audio Rendering**: The application enables custom audio rendering.

3. **Join a Channel**: The application sends a request through the SDK to join a communication channel in the Agora SD-RTN.

4. **Pull Remote Audio Data**: The application retrieves (pulls) remote audio data from the channel through the SDK.

5. **You Render the Obtained Audio Data Yourself**: Indicates that the application handles the rendering of the obtained audio data on its own, outside of the SDKâ€™s standard rendering process.

6. **Leave the Channel**: The application sends a request to leave the channel.

7. **Destroy the Engine**: The application issues a command to terminate the engine, concluding its operations.

This flowchart demonstrates the lifecycle of utilizing an SDK for custom audio processing and management within a networked environment, specifically using the Agora platform.
