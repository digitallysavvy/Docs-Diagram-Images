The image displays a flowchart representing the integration and operation process of spatial audio features using the Agora SDK within an application's client-server architecture.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Enable Spatial Audio**: The process starts with the user enabling spatial audio capabilities.

2. **Initialize Local Spatial Audio Engine**:
   - Creation and initialization of the local spatial audio engine through Agora's SDK, facilitated by both the userâ€™s client device and the server.

3. **Spatial Audio Effects for Users**:
   - Transmission of the user's local spatial position to the server.
   - Reception and updating of spatial positions between the local user and remote users, ensuring a dynamic audio environment where the audio reflects user positions.

4. **Spatial Audio Effects for Media Player**:
   - Setting the spatial positions for both the user and the media player, enhancing the auditory experience.

5. **Send and Receive Spatial Audio**: 
   - Continuous exchange of spatial audio data to achieve an immersive sound experience.

6. **Clean Up**:
   - Clearing the positions of remote participants and shutting down the spatial audio engine when no longer needed.

This chart is structured in a way to show interactions between "Your client and server" and the "Agora" modules, highlighting the seamless process of enabling and managing spatial audio via Agora SDK. The stages are clearly defined and are critical for developers implementing spatial audio functionalities in their applications.
