The image is a flowchart diagram that outlines the process flow in a video communication software using a video SDK (Software Development Kit). The flowchart is divided into several parts showing interaction steps from a user's perspective along with the corresponding technical actions that occur behind the scenes in the application, likely implemented using the Agora video SDK.

Here's the breakdown of the processes shown:

1. **User opens the app**: The app is initialized to handle local hardware (like camera and microphone) and prepare for streaming.
2. **Start Call**:
   - **Creation of the Agora Engine**: The app calls `useRTCClient(AgoraRTC.createClient)` to create a real-time communication client.
   - **Authentication**: The app retrieves an authentication token to join a communication channel.
   - **Channel Join**: User joins a channel using `useJoin`, and the join is accepted.
   - **Media Preparation**: Local media tracks are created for the camera and microphone.
   - **Media Publishing**: These local media tracks are then pushed to the channel for streaming.
3. **During the Call**:
   - **Media Retrieval and Interaction**: Streams from other users are retrieved and played (both video and audio).
   - **Data exchange**: Data is received and sent continuously between users in the session.
4. **End Call**:
   - **Leave Channel**: The user leaves the channel by again calling `useJoin`.

This flowchart is useful for developers to understand how the parts of video communication work using the SDK, showing how to handle sessions, manage media, and control user interactions in an application that involves video calling. The reference to "Agora" indicates that this is specific to the Agora platform, which is a service for implementing real-time communication features in apps.
