This image depicts a flowchart outlining the process for implementing and managing spatial audio using the Agora engine in an application. The flowchart is divided into several main sections, detailing the steps from initialization to termination:

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Create and initialize the Agora engine**: This step involves setting up the primary engine needed for audio and possibly video functionalities within an app.
   - **Initialize the spatial audio engine**: A specialized engine to handle spatial audio processing is initialized.

2. **Configuration:**
   - **Set up an audio profile and audio scenario**: Configuring the audio characteristics and usage scenario.
   - **Set up a channel profile and client role**: Defining how the app will use channels and the role of the client within these channels.
   - **Join a channel**: The process for actually joining a designated audio channel.

3. **Audio Stream Management:**
   - **Mute all remote audio streams**: Ensuring no external audio streams interfere initially.
   - **Set the number of receivable audio streams**: Configuring how many external streams can be handled.
   - **Set the audio receiving range**: Defining the spatial limits for receiving audio.
   - **Set the distance unit in meters**: Establishing the measurement units for audio distance.

4. **Spatial Audio Effects for Users:**
   - **Update self position**: Adjusting the user’s position in the spatial audio context.
   - **Update remote user positions**: Adjusting positions of other users in the audio space.

5. **Spatial Audio Effects for Media Player:**
   - **Update self position**: Similar to the users’ update but specifically for the media player’s position.
   - **Update player position**: Adjusting the position of the audio source or media player.

6. **Termination:**
   - **Clear remote positions**: Removing all spatial data about other users.
   - **Destroy the spatial audio engine and Agora engine**: Properly shutting down all engine operations.
   - **Leave the channel**: Exiting the communications channel.

Each of these steps is visually represented with arrows indicating the flow and execution order within the Agora framework, giving developers insight into the necessary components and sequence to effectively implement spatial audio functionalities.
