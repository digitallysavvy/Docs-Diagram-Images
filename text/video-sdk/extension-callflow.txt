The image depicts a flowchart explaining the process of audio and video data handling in an application, more specifically detailing how extensions for audio/video filtering integrate within a Video Software Development Kit (SDK). Here are the key components and their flow as illustrated:

1. **Video SDK Section:**
   - **Capture:** The initial phase where video or audio data is captured.
   - **Pre-process:** The captured data is processed initially, likely for optimization or format correction.
   - **Encode:** The pre-processed data is encoded for transmission.
   - **Transmit:** The encoded data is then transmitted, possibly over a network.
   - **Decode:** Received data is decoded to a usable format.
   - **Post-process:** The decoded data may undergo further processing to enhance quality or for other modifications.
   - **Play:** The final processed data is then ready to be played in the application.

2. **Audio/Video Filter Extensions:**
   - This function acts as a bridge connecting various filtering capabilities to the main data stream managed by the Video SDK.
   - It directs audio or video data between the SDK functions (Encode, Transmit, Decode, Post-process) and the specific extensions providing additional processing capabilities.

3. **Extensions (Encapsulated Audio or Video Processing Capabilities):**
   - The green dashed box encapsulates the range of additional processing features that can be applied to the audio or video data:
       - **Image Enhancement:** Improves visual quality of video.
       - **Face Filter:** Applies real-time filters to faces in the video.
       - **Face Change:** Modifies or swaps faces in video.
       - **Voice Effect:** Adds effects to audio.
       - **Voice Changer:** Alters the pitch or tone of voices in the audio.
       - **Noise Cancellation:** Reduces background noise in the audio stream.

This diagram effectively represents the integration of advanced media processing tools within a standard Video SDK framework, emphasizing the modularity and extensibility of modern video and audio applications.
