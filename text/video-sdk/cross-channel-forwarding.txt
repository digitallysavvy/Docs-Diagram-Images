The image shows a flowchart detailing the process involved in cross-channel media stream forwarding using a software development kit (SDK) and a cloud-based service (Agora SD-RTN). The flowchart is divided into several phases including initialization, starting, renewing, pausing, recovering, and stopping of the media stream forwarding. Here's a breakdown of each phase:

1. **App: Host** - Represents the actions performed by the host application.
   - Create and initialize the engine.
   - Join the channel and set the user role as the host.

2. **SDK** - Represents the intermediary software functions facilitating the operations.
   - Aligns actions such as forwarding media stream requests to a target channel, and responding to commands like pausing or resuming media streams.

3. **Agora SD-RTN** - Cloud service functionalities.
   - Manages real-time network streaming and processes requests sent from the SDK.

The specific actions within each phase include:
- **Start**: Initiate cross-channel media stream forwarding.
- **Renew**: Update the target channel information for ongoing media forwarding.
- **Pause**: Temporarily halts the media stream forwarding.
- **Recover**: Resume the media stream forwarding after a pause.
- **Stop**: End the media stream forwarding, leave the channel, and destroy the engine.

The diagram illustrates the interaction between the host application, the SDK, and the cloud service to facilitate complex operations like cross-channel media streaming. This typically applies to scenarios like live broadcasting or multi-channel media sharing where coordinated stream management is necessary.
