This image outlines a diagrammatic representation of a streaming architecture involving a host and an audience, both equipped with Agora Video SDK. The central element, identified as "Agora SD-RTN™" (Software-Defined Real-Time Network), acts as a cloud service facilitating the connection. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Host**: The host system equipped with Agora Video SDK is shown on the left. The host can join a channel, publish a stream, and subscribe to a stream.

2. **Audience**: On the right side is the audience system, also equipped with Agora Video SDK. The audience can join a channel and subscribe to a stream.

3. **Flow of Operations**:
   - Both the host and the audience systems connect to the Agora SD-RTN™.
   - The host publishes a stream to the Agora network, which then makes it accessible to the audience.
   - Both systems can join a specific channel, which is a medium for communication and data transfer.

The overall structure depicted represents a simplified model of how live video streaming technology like Agora operates, enabling real-time interaction between hosts and audiences through a managed cloud service.
