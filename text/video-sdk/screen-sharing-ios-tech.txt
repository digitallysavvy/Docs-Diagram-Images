This image appears to be a diagram or flowchart illustrating a system's architecture or process related to screen sharing and streaming. Here’s a breakdown of the components:

1. **Main Process**: This seems to be the central functional block managing operations. It receives inputs from the blue cloud labeled "agora SD-RTN™" and outputs to an "Extension."

2. **Extension**: This block is likely related to additional functionalities or modules that work with the main process. It sends instructions labeled as "Screen sharing instructions" back to the Main Process and initiates a "Screen sharing stream."

3. **Screen Sharing Stream**: This is highlighted multiple times in the diagram and indicates the main activity or data flow concerning screen sharing functionalities.

4. **Other Streams**: Mentioned with arrows pointing towards the blue cloud, suggesting other types of data or media streams used by the system, possibly running alongside the primary screen sharing stream.

5. **Agora SD-RTN™**: This cloud signifies a network or platform, likely providing infrastructure or network services that facilitate streaming and data transmission.

Overall, the diagram seems to depict how screen sharing is initiated and managed within a specific technological setup, possibly for a software application or service that uses the Agora real-time network for its operation.
