The image is a flowchart detailing the process of how a user interacts with a software application using the Agora Video SDK (Software Development Kit). The flowchart starts with a user opening the app and involves multiple steps including creating an instance of Agora Engine, enabling audio and video, joining a channel using an authentication token, audio mixing (including starting, processing, and stopping audio), changing audio routes, and ultimately leaving the channel. The diagram is structured to show the sequence of actions and decisions within the application, aided by the Agora SDK and interfaced through SD-RTN, suggesting the utilization of real-time networking services.
