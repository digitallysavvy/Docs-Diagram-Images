This image is a flowchart that outlines the integration of a video SDK, specifically for a Video Call using the Agora platform, within a gaming application. The flowchart is divided into various stages of user interaction and SDK processes:

1. **User Opens Game**: The flowchart starts when the user initiates the game.
2. **Create an RtcEngine Instance**: The SDK begins by creating an instance of `RtcEngine` from Agora.
3. **Set the Context**: The next step is to set the context which includes the app ID and other parameters related to channel profile and audio scenarios.
4. **Initialize RtcEngine**: Once the context is set, the `RtcEngine` is initialized.
5. **Start a Video Call**:
   - **Enable the Video Module**: This step involves enabling the video capabilities of the SDK.
   - **Set User Role as Broadcaster**: The user is given the role of a broadcaster.
   - **Join Channel**: The user joins a video call channel.
6. **Leave Call**:
   - **Leave the Channel**: The user exits the channel.
   - **Disable Video Modules**: Video modules are disabled post call.
7. **Close Game**:
   - **Clean up Local Resources**: The SDK cleans up resources, disposing of the `RtcEngine`.

The flowchart details the technical steps necessary for managing video call functionalities through the Agora SDK in a gaming context, showing how user interactions correspond to SDK operations.
