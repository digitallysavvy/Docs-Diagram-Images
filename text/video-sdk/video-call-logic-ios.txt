The image shows a flowchart diagram outlining the sequence of processes and interactions involved when a user utilizes a video SDK (Software Development Kit) in an app utilizing Agora services. Here’s a breakdown of the steps portrayed in the diagram:

1. **User Operations:**
   - Opens the app.
   - Engages with the Video SDK.
   - Leaves the call.
   - Closes the app.

2. **Host Operations:**
   - Starts a call.
   - Leaves the call.

3. **System Interactions:**
   - Initiation of the Video SDK engine (`AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine`).
   - Setting up the local video stream (`enableVideo()`).
   - Setting the client role to broadcaster (`setClientRole(.broadcaster)`).
   - Starting the local video (`setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)`).
   - Joining the channel (`joinChannel`).
   - Retrieving streaming from another user (`setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)`).
   - Sending and receiving data streams.
   - Stopping the local video preview (`stopPreview()`).
   - Leaving the channel (`leaveChannel(nil)`).
   - Cleaning up local resources (`AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()`).

The chart divides responsibilities between user actions and the backend processes handled by the host and the Agora services (indicated as "Your app" and "Agora" with SD-RTN). This flow provides a clear visualization of the user’s journey from start to end in the context of a video call application using Agora's SDK.
