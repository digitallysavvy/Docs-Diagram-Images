The image depicts a flowchart or a system architecture diagram relating to the use of an SDK (Software Development Kit) with an application (App) for custom audio capture in integration with Agora SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-Time Network). Here is a breakdown of the elements and processes illustrated:

1. **App**: Represents the user application interface which initiates the audio capture and processing process.
2. **SDK**: It interfaces between the App and the Agora SD-RTN, handling tasks as outlined in the flowchart.
3. **Agora SD-RTN**: Portrayed as a cloud service, it likely manages real-time audio/video streaming and networking services.

### Key Steps Highlighted in Diagram:
- **Create and initialize the engine**: Initially setting up the audio engine in the app.
- **Custom audio capture**:
  - **Set up an external audio source for use**: Preparation for capturing audio through an external device.
  - **Join a channel**: Entering a communication or broadcast channel.
  - **Send the processed audio data**: Transmitting the audio data after processing it within the SDK.
  - **Leave the channel**: Exiting the communication channel once the session is complete.
  - **Destroy the engine**: Proper shutdown and cleanup of the audio engine.
  
- **Agora SD-RTN interaction**:
  - **You manage audio data capture and processing on your own**: Suggests that while using Agora SD-RTN, the handling and processing of audio data must be managed by the application/SDK, not by Agora.
  - **Request to join the channel**: Shows interaction between the SDK and Agora SD-RTN for channel joining.
  - **Request to leave the channel**: Interaction for leaving the channel with Agora SD-RTN.

This diagram efficiently outlines the process of integrating an app with a real-time networking solution using an SDK, focusing on custom audio capture and channel management.
