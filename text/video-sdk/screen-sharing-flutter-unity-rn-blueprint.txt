This image depicts a flowchart describing the screen sharing process in a software system. There are three main components shown:

1. **Extension Process**: This initiates the screen sharing by sending a screen sharing command and publishing a screen sharing stream.

2. **Main Process**: This component handles the publishing of the screen sharing stream to other parts of the system and also subscribes to other streams.

3. **Agora SD-RTN**: This seems to represent a server or network service, possibly for distributing the screen sharing stream to other users or systems.

The arrows between the components indicate the flow of commands and data among the Extension Process, Main Process, and Agora SD-RTN, showcasing how the screen sharing data is managed and distributed.
