This image illustrates a flow diagram detailing a process for video capture and handling using third-party software and the Agora SDK (Software Development Kit). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each step:

1. **Video to be captured:** The starting point where the video originates.
2. **Third-party video capture module:** The initial handling of the video involves using a third-party module to capture the video.
3. **Captured video frames:** The output from the third-party module, which are the frames of the captured video.
4. **Agora SDK:** These video frames are then processed or passed through the Agora SDK.
5. **Custom video track:** Post processing, the video is converted into a custom video track suitable for further use.
6. **Main channel:** Finally, the custom video track is sent to the main channel for distribution or broadcasting.

This flowchart is typical for applications or systems that need to integrate video capture with additional processing or encoding before final output or transmission.
