The image is a flowchart detailing the process for integrating and operating a video streaming or conferencing setup using the Agora Video SDK, along with the Agora Software-Defined Real-Time Network (SD-RTN). Here is a step-by-step description based on the flowchart:

1. **Create a Local Client**: 
   - A local client is created using the `AgoraRTC.createClient` function, setting the mode to `"live"`.

2. **Set User Role**: 
   - The user role is set to either `"host"` or `"audience"` using the `AgoraRTCClient.setClientRole` method.

3. **Join Channel**: 
   - The application triggers the `AgoraRTCClient.join` to join a specific channel.

4. **Create and Publish Local Audio and Video Tracks** (if the user role is `'host'`):
   - A local audio track is created with `AgoraRTC.createMicrophoneAudioTrack`.
   - A local video track is created with `AgoraRTC.createCameraVideoTrack`.
   - Both tracks are then published using `AgoraRTCClient.publish`.

5. **Subscribe to Remote Users**: 
   - The application listens for events of remote users publishing audio and video using `client.on("user-published")`.
   - It retrieves remote user objects via `AgoraRTCClient.remoteUsers`.
   - Subscribes to the remote user's audio and video objects using `AgoraRTCClient.subscribe`.

6. **Leave the Channel**: 
   - Turns off the local audio and video tracks using `MicrophoneAudioTrack.close` and `CameraVideoTrack.close`.
   - The client leaves the channel using `AgoraRTCClient.leave`.

The flowchart also shows the communication between the App, Video SDK, and the Agora SD-RTN, including setting up, publishing, subscribing, and transmission of audio/video data. This visual representation helps in understanding the technical steps involved in setting up and managing a live audio/video session using Agora's services.
