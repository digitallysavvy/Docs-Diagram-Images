The image depicts a flowchart that outlines the process for interacting with a video Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Agora platform for live streaming events. This diagram illustrates the steps involved for two roles: the Host and the Audience, interacting with Your App integrated with a Video SDK that communicates with Agora's SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-time Network).

Key steps for the Host:
1. **Open App**: The user opens the application.
2. **Initiate Video SDK Engine**: Establish a client using `AgoraRTC.createClient`.
3. **Start Video in the Engine and Local Media**: Initialize the app and create a media stream which is then played.
4. **Start Live Streaming Event**: The host retrieves an authentication token.
5. **Set User Role as Host**: Using `agoraEngine.setClientRole("host")`.
6. **Join a Channel as Host**: Connect to the channel.
7. **Push Local Media to the Channel**: Publish the local media stream.

Key steps for the Audience:
1. **Join Live Streaming Event**: Similar initial steps to the host, like opening the app and initializing the video SDK.
2. **Retrieve Authentication Token and Set User Role (Audience)**.
3. **Join the Live Stream Event**: The audience joins in a similar manner as the host.
4. **Retrieve and Subscribe to Streams**: Audience members receive and subscribe to the stream from the host.
5. **Receive Data Stream**: Finally, the audience gets the live data stream.

This flowchart effectively outlines the technological interactions necessary for live streaming using specific software tools, showcasing the initialization, operation, participation, and closure of a live streaming session.
