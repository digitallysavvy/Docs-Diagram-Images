The image depicts a flowchart that outlines an integration process involving the Agora Video SDK, specifically focused on a video screenshot upload module. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process depicted:

1. **Your App**: This represents the application that is integrating the Agora Video SDK.

2. **Agora Video SDK - Video screenshot upload module**: This is part of the Agora Video SDK that handles taking screenshots from a video and uploading them.

3. **Take a screenshot and upload an image**: This arrow indicates the action of capturing a screenshot and uploading the captured image to Agora's cloud.

4. **Agora SD-RTN™ Cloud**: This is where the image is processed or stored temporarily. The cloud is denoted as SD-RTN™, likely referring to a specific technology or cloud solution by Agora.

5. **Upload Image**: The process involving the actual upload of the image from Agora cloud to a third-party cloud storage is highlighted here.

6. **Your third-party cloud storage**: This is where the image is finally stored after being uploaded from the Agora system.

7. **HTTP callback notification**: This arrow indicates that once the upload is complete, an HTTP callback notification is sent to your application server.

8. **Your application server**: This is the server on which your application backend might be running, which receives notifications about the screenshot upload events.

This visual diagram is useful for developers or system architects to understand how to integrate and handle screenshot uploads using the Agora Video SDK and cloud services in their applications.
