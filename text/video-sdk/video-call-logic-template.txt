This image is a flowchart detailing the process steps involved when a user interacts with a video communication application using a Video SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by Agora. The software architecture includes an SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network) from Agora, which facilitates the communication and data streams.

Here are the key steps depicted in the flowchart:

1. **User Opens the App**: The user starts the application on their device.
2. **Initiate the Video SDK Engine**: The app initiates the video SDK engine to prepare for video streaming.
3. **Start Video in the Engine**: The engine starts processing video data to be ready for streaming.
4. **Host Starts the Call**: The host of the call initiates the call process.
5. **All Users Broadcast to the Channel**: Users connect and stream their video and audio to the channel.
6. **Join the Channel**: This step involves joining a communication channel to enable multi-participant interactions.
7. **Retrieve Streaming and Data Streams**: The participants retrieve and exchange video streams along with other data.
8. **User Leaves the Call**: Actions to disconnect and stop streaming video and audio data.
9. **Stop Local Video and Leave the Channel**: The user stops their video and exits the channel.
10. **Clean Up Local Resources**: After leaving the channel, the application cleans up or releases local resources used during the call.
11. **Close the Application**: Finally, the user closes the app, which terminates any remaining connections or processes related to the call.

This flowchart is a typical representation of how video communication software manages and orchestrates the sequence of events during a video call session.
