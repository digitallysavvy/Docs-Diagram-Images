This image is a flowchart describing the operations of a Video SDK (Software Development Kit) integrated within an application that interacts with the Agora SD-RTN (Software-Defined Real-Time Network). The flowchart outlines the following steps:

1. **User Opens App**: This triggers the initiation of the Agora Video SDK engine.
2. **Initiate Agora Video SDK Engine**: This is done by creating an instance of the `RtcEngine`.
3. **Enable Video Module**: The video capabilities of the engine are activated.
4. **User Joins a Call**:
    - **Setup Local Video**: The local video is configured using a `VideoCanvas` object.
    - **Start Local Preview**: A preview of the local video starts.
    - **Retrieve Authentication Token**: An authentication token is retrieved to enable joining a channel.
    - **Join the Channel**: The user joins a designated video channel.
    - **Remote User Joined**: Detects when a remote user joins the channel.
    - **Display Video from Remote User**: The video feed from a remote user is set up for display.
5. **User Leaves the Call**: The user leaves the video channel.
6. **Close App**:
    - **Leave Channel**: The user formally leaves the channel.
    - **Clean up Local Resources**: The local resources associated with the Video SDK are cleaned up and the engine is destroyed.

The flowchart demonstrates the user's interaction from opening the app, managing video communication, to closing the app and cleaning up resources.
