This image presents a flowchart diagram of a video processing system with various stages mapped out. The process can be summarized into the following steps:

1. **Enable local video collection** - This step likely involves capturing or accessing video data from a local source.

2. **Video Pre-processing** - At this stage, the video undergoes preliminary processing, which may include adjustments such as filtering, frame rate conversion, or aspect ratio adjustments.

3. **Video Encoding** - The pre-processed video is then encoded. This typically compresses and converts the raw video data to a suitable format for transmission or storage.

4. **Local Preview** - The encoded video is available for local preview, allowing for quality checks or real-time viewing before transmission.

5. **Video Decoding** - The encoded video is decoded back into a format suitable for viewing or further processing.

6. **Video Post-processing** - After decoding, the video can undergo additional processing such as color correction, scaling, or other effects.

7. **Video Rendering Display** - The post-processed video is then rendered on a display device.

8. **Join Channel** - Finally, the video is transmitted over a network, where it joins a streaming channel or a communication channel for broadcast or remote viewing.

The diagram is divided into two modules - one for video processing (video module) and another for networking (network module), indicating modular design in the system architecture.
