This image is a flowchart diagram that explains the process of how a user interacts with a video SDK (Software Development Kit) within an app, possibly using the Agora platform (as indicated by the API references). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps shown in the diagram:

1. **User Opens the App**:
   - The user opens your application.

2. **Video SDK Initialization**:
   - The `RTCEngine.create` function initializes the video SDK engine.
   - `Engine.enableVideo` enables video functionalities within the SDK.
   - `Engine.joinChannel` allows the user to join a channel.
   - `Engine.on("joinChannelSuccess")` is a callback that confirms successful channel joining.

3. **Host (Starting the Broadcast)**:
   - The host starts the broadcast.
   - The host publishes the video stream using the `Publish` function.
   - As the data stream is sent, the `Send data stream` function is triggered.
   - The host sets up a local video view using `Widget = RtcLocalView.SurfaceView`.

4. **Join Broadcast (User Side)**:
   - As other users join, `Engine.on("userJoined")` is triggered to notify the host of new participants.
   - The host then subscribes to the incoming video streams using the `Subscribe` function.
   - The host receives the data stream and sets up remote video views for other participants using `Widget = RtcRemoteView.SurfaceView`.

5. **User Leaves the Broadcast**:
   - The user can leave the channel by invoking `Engine.leaveChannel`.

This diagram is commonly used to depict the interaction flow in real-time communication applications, focusing on video streaming and broadcasting functionalities.
