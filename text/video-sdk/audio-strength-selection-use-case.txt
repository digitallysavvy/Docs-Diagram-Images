This image illustrates a diagram of a network architecture, specifically related to audio streaming using a system branded as "Agora SD-RTNâ„¢". The diagram shows multiple streaming endpoints, labeled variably from "Streaming end 1" to "Streaming end D", each sending different audio streams (from "Audio stream 1" to "Audio stream D") through a cloud labeled as "Agora". The audio streams are then sent to various receiving ends. This setup implies a scalable and distributed real-time network, probably used for applications such as live broadcasting, voice and video conferencing, or real-time online classes.
