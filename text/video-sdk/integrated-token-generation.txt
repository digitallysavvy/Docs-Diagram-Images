This image depicts a flowchart representing the process of user authentication and authorization in an application, using an Agora authentication token. The flow is divided into segments showing different responsibilities:

1. **User and App Interaction**:
   - A user starts the app.
   - The user selects a channel within the app.

2. **Implemented by You** (The application developer's responsibilities):
   - The user logs into the identity management system you provide.
   - The system requests an Agora authentication token using parameters such as channel name, role, token type, and user ID.

3. **Provided by Agora** (Services used from Agora):
   - The Agora system validates the user request against internal security measures.
   - Utilizes integrated Agora library methods to generate a token.
   - Validates the token.

4. **Token and Session Management**:
   - The token is returned to the client (the app).
   - The client (app) then uses this token along with user ID and channel name to join a channel.
   - A callback is triggered after the user is added to the channel which likely confirms successful channel joining.

The diagram effectively illustrates how different components and systems (implemented by the developer and provided by Agora) interact and cooperate to enable secure user authentication and subsequent actions within an app.
