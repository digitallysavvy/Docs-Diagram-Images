This image appears to be a flowchart or a diagram that outlines the process flow of screen capture functions and their integration with the Agora SDK, specifically for streaming or transmitting screen capture data via Agora's SD-RTN (Software Defined Real-time Network).

The flow comprises the following steps:
1. **getScreenCaptureSources**: This function likely retrieves potential sources for screen capture, such as different screens or windows open on the user's computer.
2. From this function, the flow splits into two branches depending on the source of the screen capture:
   - **startScreenCaptureByDisplayId** for capturing an entire display.
   - **startScreenCaptureByWindowId** for capturing a specific window.
3. Both branches then lead to the **joinChannelEx** function, which has a parameter indicating `publishScreenTrack: true`. This suggests that once the screen capture is initiated, the screen capture stream will be published on a channel.
4. The flow finally connects to the Agora SD-RTN, indicating that the captured screen data is transmitted over Agoraâ€™s network.

The flowchart is designed to visually represent how different pieces of software interact to achieve screen capturing and streaming using Agora's technologies.
