The image depicts a sequence diagram for a live streaming event integrated within a game environment using a Video SDK, likely from the company Agora. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process illustrated:

1. **User Opens the Game:**
   - The user starts by opening the game which integrates video streaming functionalities.

2. **Initialization of Video SDK:**
   - An instance of the RtcEngine is created.
   - The channel profile is set to "CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING" to facilitate live streaming.
   - The context is set with specific configurations (App ID, channel profile for broadcasting, and default audio scenario).

3. **Host Starts a Live Streaming Event:**
   - The video module is enabled for the host.
   - The user role is set as a host (broadcaster).
   - The host joins a channel to start streaming.

4. **Audience Joins Live Streaming Event:**
   - The video module is also enabled for the audience.
   - The user role is set as an audience member.
   - The audience joins the channel to view the stream.

5. **Ending the Session:**
   - Audience members leave the call and the channel.
   - Video modules are disabled, and video rendering for remote and local views is stopped on the user's device.
   - The host similarly leaves the channel, disables video modules, stops video rendering, and cleans up the local resources by disposing of the RtcEngine instance.

6. **User Closes the Game:**
   - The sequence concludes with the user closing the game, following the cleanup of resources related to the live streaming event.

This sequence diagram efficiently outlines the operational flow of setting up, conducting, and concluding a live streamed event within a gaming context, facilitated by specific API calls and actions on both the host's and the audience's ends.
