This image depicts the process flow for screen sharing using a video software development kit (SDK) integrated with the Agora SD-RTN service. The leftmost column represents actions taken by the application (App), the middle column delineates the steps involving the Video SDK, and the rightmost column represents the actions involving the Agora SD-RTN cloud service. The flowchart explains the sequence of events from setting up a high-quality scene, starting the screen capture, setting the screen sharing scene, and joining a channel to updating screen sharing parameters and finally, stopping the screen sharing. Corresponding actions in the Video SDK and Agora SD-RTN service like publishing the stream, updating it, and ceasing the stream publication are shown aligned with the application events. The diagram uses arrow lines for interaction and dashed lines to represent optional steps.
