This image is a flowchart diagram depicting the process of a user interacting with a video software development kit (SDK) as part of an application. The process involves various stages including:

1. **Opening the App**: The user starts by opening the application.
2. **Creating an Instance of the Video SDK Engine**: This is where the video SDK is initialized within the app.
3. **Enabling Audio and Video in the Engine**: The user enables the necessary functionalities to use audio and video.
4. **Setting Up External Source**: Checks are performed to ensure compatibility of external video or audio sources, and then these sources are set up.
5. **Joining a Channel**: The user retrieves an authentication token and joins a communication or media channel.
6. **Processing Data**: Here, the app manages capturing and processing data using external methods.
7. **Streaming Data**: The application pushes external video or audio frames for streaming.
8. **Leaving the Channel**: Ultimately, the user leaves the channel.
9. **Closing the Video SDK**: The process is completed by the user exiting the video SDK functionalities.

The right-hand side of the diagram shows an entity labeled "Agora" connected with "SD-RTN", suggesting that the SDK may be utilizing Agora's technologies for real-time networking. The diagram provides a clear step-by-step visualization of how a user would utilize a video SDK within an application from start to finish.
