The image depicts a sequence diagram for implementing a call setup, management, and termination using three entities: client, token server, and Agora platform. This diagram is split into three major processes: "Setup client," "Run call," and "End call." Each process involves interactions between the client and the token server, as well as actions performed on the Agora platform. Different steps to set up the client based on the role (host or audience), manage the audio and video connections, join the channel, communicate over the channel, and finally leave the call and close connections are shown in detail. This type of diagram helps in understanding the flow and interactions needed for implementing audio and video calls in an application.
