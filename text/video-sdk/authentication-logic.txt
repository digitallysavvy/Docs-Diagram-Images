The image displays a flowchart that outlines the process of token generation and renewal for authentication in a system that involves interacting with an app and a token server. The image is divided into three main columns indicating which entity is responsible for each part of the process: "Implemented by you", "App", and "Provided by Agora SD-RTN".

1. **Join a channel with authentication:**
   - A token is requested using details like channel name, role, token type, and user ID.
   - This request undergoes internal security validation.
   - A token is then generated by the token server and returned to the client.

2. **App and Agora SD-RTN interaction:**
   - The app joins a channel using a user ID, channel name, and the generated token.
   - The token is validated by the Agora system.
   - A callback is triggered after the user is added to the channel.
   - An event is triggered indicating that the token privilege will soon expire.

3. **Renew token:**
   - A request for a new token is made using the channel name, role, token type, and user ID.
   - This request is validated against internal logic.
   - A fresh token is generated by the token server and returned to the client.
   - The app sends this new token with a RenewToken request.

This flowchart is likely used to guide software developers on integrating and managing secure access to channels or sessions managed by Agora's software development platform.
