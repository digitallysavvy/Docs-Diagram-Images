This image is a flowchart diagram illustrating the sequence of operations involved in using a Chat SDK (Software Development Kit), specifically for integrating chat functionalities with a server, labeled here as "Agora" which might indicate the use of the Agora service platform.

Here's a breakdown of the steps in the flowchart:

1. **Initialize**:
   - **Open app**: The initial step where a user initiates the application.
   - **Init a chat SDK instance**: Initializing the SDK with specific options.
   - **Add message event callbacks**: Setting up event handlers for message events in the chat.

2. **Log in**:
   - **Join a chat**: The user joins a chat session.
   - **Retrieve authentication token for the user**: Obtaining the necessary authentication.
   - **Log in to the chat server**: The actual process of logging into the remote chat server.
   - **onConnected() callback**: A callback function that is executed once the connection is established.

3. **Send messages**:
   - **Send a message**: User sends a message.
   - **Create a ChatMessage**: Formatting the message in a suitable data structure.
   - **Send the ChatMessage**: The message is sent to the chat server for distribution.

4. **Receive messages**:
   - **onMessageReceived(messages) callback**: An event that triggers when a message is received from the chat server.
   - **Display message**: The received message is displayed on the user interface.

5. **Close**:
   - **Leave the chat**: The user exits the chat.
   - **Log out**: Disconnecting from the chat server and logging out.

6. The flowchart illustrates interaction between the user, your application (Chat SDK), and the chat server throughout the process.

This visualization helps developers understand the operational flow and interactions when integrating chat functionalities into an application using a specified SDK, in this case hinted to be associated with Agora.
