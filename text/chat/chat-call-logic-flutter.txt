The image displays a sequence diagram for a chat application using the Agora Chat SDK interacting with a Chat Server. It outlines the various steps and interactions between the user, the application (Your app), the Chat SDK, and the Chat server. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process depicted:

1. **Initialize**:
   - The user opens the app.
   - The app obtains a ChatClient instance from the Agora SDK (`ChatClient.getInstance`).
   - The app initializes the instance with certain options (`ChatClient.init(options)`).
   - The app adds message event callbacks (`ChatClient.chatManager.addEventHandler(...)`).
   - The app also adds connection event callbacks (`ChatClient.addConnectionEventHandler(...)`).

2. **Log in**:
   - The user retrieves an authentication token.
   - The user then logs in to the chat server using this token (`ChatClient.loginWithAgoraToken(userId, token)`).
   - Upon successful connection, an `onConnected()` callback is triggered.

3. **Send messages**:
   - The user sends a message after creating a ChatMessage object.
   - This message is then sent through the chat manager of the ChatClient (`ChatClient.chatManager.sendMessage(message)`).

4. **Receive messages**:
   - Messages are received by an `onMessagesReceived(List<ChatMessage> messages)` callback.
   - The received messages are then displayed to the user.

5. **Close**:
   - The user leaves the chat.
   - The ChatClient logs out (`ChatClient.logout(...)`).

Each major action from initialization, logging in, message handling, and closing, has corresponding methods showing interaction with the Agora services and providing a structured flow of operations within the chat service environment.
