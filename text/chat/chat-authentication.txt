This image is a flowchart illustrating the communication between an "App Server" and an "Agora Chat Server" during an API call process with token-based authentication. Hereâ€™s the process breakdown:

1. **Generate a token with app privileges**: This step is performed by the App Server. It generates a token that is equipped with application-specific privileges.

2. **Use the token with app privileges to call Agora Chat RESTful APIs**: This step includes the App Server using the generated token to make API calls to the Agora Chat Server.

3. **Validate the token with app privileges**: At the Agora Chat Server, there is a validation of the token received from the App Server to ensure that it has the correct privileges and has not been tampered with.

4. **Return the response parameters after successful RESTful API calls**: Finally, after validating the token and processing the API request, the response parameters are sent back to the App Server from the Agora Chat Server.

The diagram parts labeled blue (Agora Chat Server blocks and "Provide by Agora") indicate components or actions provided by Agora, while the parts in grey (App Server blocks) indicate components that need to be implemented by yourself. This flow ensures secure, authenticated, and authorized communication between the application server and the chat service backend.
