The image you provided is a flowchart diagram that describes the process for a user joining a channel with authentication using an app, a developerâ€™s authentication system, and an API provided by a service called Agora. Here's a breakdown of the steps illustrated in the diagram:

1. **User Interaction with App:**
   - The user starts the app.
   - The user selects a channel to join.

2. **App's Interaction with Developer's Authentication System:**
   - The user logs into the developer's authentication system.

3. **Request for Authentication:**
   - The app requests an Agora authentication token using details such as channel name, user role, token type, and user ID.

4. **Validation and Token Generation:**
   - The developer's authentication system validates the user request against internal security measures.
   - The developer's system uses an integrated Agora library to generate a token.

5. **Token Handling:**
   - The token is returned to the client (app).

6. **Joining a Channel:**
   - The user joins a channel using their user ID, the channel name, and the token provided.

7. **Final Steps in App:**
   - After the user is added to the channel, a callback is triggered within the app.

The diagram effectively outlines the technical process involving user authentication and token management for accessing a channel, presumably for a communication or content delivery service. The overall process ensures that interactions are secure and authenticated properly using the Agora API.
