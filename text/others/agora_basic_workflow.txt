The image is a flow diagram showing a process involving a platform named "Agora". Here's a breakdown of the flow:

1. **Access Token Retrieval**: A server is depicted at the bottom, which is responsible for retrieving an AccessToken with user and call permissions. This is labeled as step "1".

2. **Connection Process**: The AccessToken is then used to connect to the Agora Platform from three different types of devices:
   - A laptop
   - A desktop computer
   - A smartphone

   This step is labeled as "2" on each arrow leading from the devices to the cloud labeled "Platform".

This diagram likely represents a workflow for establishing a connection to a communication or collaboration platform (Agora) using secure tokens to manage authentication and permissions for each device involved in the process.
