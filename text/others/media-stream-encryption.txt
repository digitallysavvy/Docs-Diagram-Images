The image is a flowchart diagram that illustrates a process for media stream encryption in an app using a Video SDK engine. It details the interaction between the user, the app, the developerâ€™s authentication system, and an API provided by Agora. Here are the primary steps depicted in the diagram:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user starts the app.
   - This initiates the Video SDK engine.

2. **Media Stream Encryption**:
   - The user logs into the developer's authentication system via the app.
   - The app requests a 32-byte encryption key from the developer's system.
     - The key is generated using OpenSSL and provided back to the app.
   - The app requests a 32-byte salt in Base64 format.
     - The salt is generated in Base64 format using OpenSSL and provided back to the app.
   - The app then creates an encryption configuration using the received key and salt.

3. **Channel Selection and Joining**:
   - The user selects a channel to join through the app.
   - The app calls the method to set the encryption configuration and attempts to join a channel with a user ID, channel name, and token.
   - The join request is accepted.

4. **Encrypted Media Stream**:
   - The media stream is encrypted and the interaction continues between the user, app, and the developer's authentication system.

The blue and grey borders around the flow steps indicate the partitions of responsibility: grey for the parts implemented by the user (or by the developer for the user), dark blue for parts provided by Agora, and light blue for the general app flow. This diagram serves as a technical blueprint for developers to understand and implement encrypted communication within a video conferencing or streaming application.
