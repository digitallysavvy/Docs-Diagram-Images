The image is a screenshot of a program output or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) displaying information related to PlantUML. PlantUML is a tool used to create UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams from a plain text language.

The screenshot shows the following key elements:

1. **Header**: "Welcome to PlantUML!" indicating the program being used.
2. **Instructions and Examples**: It provides examples of how to start with a simple UML diagram, either communicating between two participants (Bob->Alice: Hello) or defining a class (class Example).
3. **Further Information Link**: The URL `https://plantuml.com` where more details on PlantUML syntax can be found.
4. **Version Information**: The version of PlantUML being used is mentioned as "PlantUML 1.2023.12."
5. **Error Message**: There appears to be an error message displayed in green and black text box which states that a file named `agora_skin.iuml` cannot be included from a relative path specified (`../images/agora_skin.iuml`). This is related to a problem in the source code or file structure in the document named `documentation_way_of_working.puml` at line 4.

This image is useful for understanding some basic operations within PlantUML and points out a typical error related to file inclusion paths that might occur during its use.
