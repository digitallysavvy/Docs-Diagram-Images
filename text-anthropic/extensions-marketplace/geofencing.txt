1. Overall Structure:
- This is a flow diagram.
- The diagram flows from left to right.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
- The main entities are represented as boxes labeled: "Capture", "Pre-process", "Encode", "Transmit", "Decode", "Post-process", and "Play".
- There is an additional box labeled "AI Noise suppression" placed above the main flow.
- The diagram starts with a box labeled "Audio and video data".

3. Data Flow:
- The flow is represented by solid lines connecting the boxes from left to right.
- The flow starts from the "Audio and video data" box, which splits into two flows: one labeled "Audio data" going up to the "AI Noise suppression" box, and the other going directly to the "Capture" box.
- The "AI Noise suppression" box connects back to the main flow, joining the line between "Capture" and "Pre-process".
- The flow continues sequentially through the remaining boxes.
