1. Overall Structure:
   - This is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - Token server
   - Your app
   - Signaling
   - Smaller boxes within "Your app" labeled "Log in to Signaling using authentication" and "Join a stream channel"
   - Smaller box within "Your app" labeled "Renew token"

3. Data Flow:
   - Solid lines connecting entities, indicating the direction of flow
   - Dashed lines within "Your app", indicating internal processes
   - A grouping labeled "Implemented by you" surrounds "Token server" and "Your app"

4. Detailed Content:
   - Token server:
     - Configure your token server using newline your App Id and App Certificate
     - Validate request against internal security newline and generate a token
     - Return RTM token to App
     - Validate request against internal security newline and generate token
     - Return RTC token to App
     - Validate request against internal security newline and generate a token
     - Return RTM token to App
   - Your app:
     - Request an RTM token using a user Id
     - Initiate the Signaling Engine using newline the App Id
     - Log in to Signaling using newline the user Id and the RTM token
     - Request an RTC token using newline a user Id, and a stream channel name
     - Join a stream channel using newline channel name, user Id, and the RTC token
     - Request an RTM token using newline the user ID
   - Signaling:
     - Validate the token
     - Log in user, then trigger callback
     - Validate the token
     - Trigger callback
     - Trigger event: newline token privilege will expire
     - Send RTM token to Signaling with a newline call to renew token
     - Validate the token

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
   - "Join a stream channel" text is positioned below "Your app"
   - "Renew token" text is positioned below "Your app"
   - "Trigger event: token privilege will expire" text is positioned to the left of "Signaling"
