1. Overall Structure:
   - This is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - User (stick figure icon)
   - Your app (box)
     - Video SDK (sub-box)
   - Agora (box) 
     - SD-RTN (sub-box)
   - Host (box)
   - Audience (box)

3. Data Flow:
   - Solid arrows represent the flow of data or actions.
   - Dashed arrows represent the return of data or responses.
   - There are two groups of elements: one for the Host and one for the Audience.

4. Detailed Content:
   - User: No text content.
   - Your app:
     - Video SDK: No text content.
   - Agora: 
     - SD-RTN: No text content.
   - Host:
     - Start live streaming event newline
     - Retrieve authentication token to join channel newline  
     - Set the user role as host: agoraEngine.setClientRole("host") newline
     - Join a channel as host: agoraEngine.join newline
     - Push local media to the channel: agoraEngine.publish
   - Audience:
     - Join live streaming event newline
     - Retrieve authentication token to join channel newline
     - Set the user role as audience: agoraEngine.setClientRole("audience") newline
     - Join the live streaming event: agoraEngine.join newline
     - Retrieve streaming from the other user: agoraEngine.on("stream-added") newline agoraEngine.subscribe newline agoraEngine.on("stream-subscribed") newline
     - Receive data stream newline
     - Leave live streaming event newline
     - agoraEngine.leave

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
   - Initiate the Video SDK engine: agoraEngine = AgoraRTC.createClient
   - Start video in the engine: App.init
   - Start local media: stream = AgoraRTC.createStream newline stream.init newline stream.play
