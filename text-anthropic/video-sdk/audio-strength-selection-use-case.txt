1. Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a flow diagram.
- The direction of the diagram is left-to-right.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
- The main entities are rectangular boxes labeled "Streaming end 1", "Streaming end A", "Streaming end B", "Streaming end C", "Streaming end D", "Receiving end", and a cloud shape labeled "agora SD-RTN™".
- Within the "Streaming end" boxes, there are smaller boxes labeled "Audio stream 1", "Audio stream 2", "Audio stream 3", "Audio stream A", "Audio stream B", "Audio stream C", and "Audio stream D".
- Within the cloud shape, there are boxes labeled "Audio stream N1", "Audio stream N2", "Audio stream N3", "Audio stream N4", "Audio stream A", "Audio stream B", "Audio stream C", and "Audio stream D".

3. Data Flow:
- Solid lines with arrowheads connect the "Streaming end" boxes to the cloud shape, indicating the flow of audio streams from the streaming ends to the cloud.
- Dashed lines with arrowheads connect the boxes within the cloud shape to the "Receiving end" boxes, indicating the flow of audio streams from the cloud to the receiving ends.
- There is a grouping of elements inside the cloud shape with the title "agora SD-RTN™".

4. Detailed Content:
- Streaming end 1: "Audio stream 1" newline "Audio stream 2" newline "Audio stream 3"
- Streaming end A: "Audio stream A"
- Streaming end B: "Audio stream B"
- Streaming end C: "Audio stream C"
- Streaming end D: "Audio stream D"
- Cloud shape (agora SD-RTN™): "Audio stream N1" newline "Audio stream N2" newline "Audio stream N3" newline "Audio stream N4" newline "Audio stream A" newline "Audio stream B" newline "Audio stream C" newline "Audio stream D"
- Receiving end: (No text content within these boxes)

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
- There is a dotted line with the label "Audio stream" pointing from the bottom-left corner to the cloud shape, possibly indicating additional audio streams not shown.
- The ellipsis "..." below "Streaming end 1" suggests additional streaming ends not depicted in the diagram.
