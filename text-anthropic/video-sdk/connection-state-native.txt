1. Overall Structure:
- This is a flow diagram.
- The direction of the diagram is from left to right.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
- The main entities are represented by rectangular boxes labeled UID 1, UID 2, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7.
- Within the main entities, there are smaller boxes with text representing events or states.

3. Data Flow:
- The connections between entities are represented by solid lines with arrows indicating the direction of the flow.
- There is a dashed line connecting T3 and T4, labeled "Network interruption".
- The elements are grouped into two parallel flows, with UID 1 at the top and UID 2 at the bottom.
- There is a note box at the bottom, labeled "SDK automatically reconnects".

4. Detailed Content:
- UID 1: joinChannel (Join channel)
- onJoinChannelSuccess: Joined the channel successfully
- onConnectionStateChanged (connection_state_connected, connection_changed_join_success): Network connection successful newline
- onConnectionStateChanged (connection_state_reconnecting, connection_changed_interrupted): Re-establishing Network connection
- onConnectionStateChanged (connection_state_reconnecting, connection_changed_lost): Network connection interrupted
- onConnectionStateChanged (connection_state_failed, connection_changed_join_failed): Network connection failed

- UID 2: (no text)
- onUserJoined: Remote user comes online
- onUserOffline (reason dropped): Remote user is offline

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
- The note box "SDK automatically reconnects" is positioned below the parallel flows, spanning the width of the diagram.
