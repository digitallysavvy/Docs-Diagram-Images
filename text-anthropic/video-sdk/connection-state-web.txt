1. Overall Structure:
   - This is a flow diagram.
   - The diagram flows from left to right.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - The main entities are represented by rectangular boxes with rounded corners.
   - There are two entities labeled "UID 1" and "UID 2" on the left side.
   - There are several smaller boxes within the diagram, labeled with identifiers like "T0", "T1", "T2", etc.
   - There are also some rounded rectangular boxes containing text descriptions.

3. Data Flow:
   - Solid lines with arrows connect the main entities and smaller boxes, indicating the direction of flow.
   - There is a dashed line grouping with the title "SDK automatically reconnects".
   - The flow starts from the "join" and "Client.on("connection-state-change")" boxes on the left.

4. Detailed Content:
   - "join" box: Join channel
   - "Client.on("connection-state-change")" box (first occurrence): "CONNECTED" newline callback report
   - "Client.publish" box: Publishes the local track
   - "Client.on("connection-state-change")" box (second occurrence): "RECONNECTING" newline callback reports
   - "Client.on("connection-state-change")" box (third occurrence): "CONNECTED" newline callback reports
   - "Client.on("user-joined")" box (first occurrence): UID 1 joins channel
   - "Client.on("user-published")" box: UID 1 release channel
   - "Client.on("user-unpublished")" box: The Agora server did not newline receive the stream of newline UID 1 for 10 sec
   - "Client.on("user-left")" box: The Agora server did not newline receive the message for 20sec newline Heartbeat packet to UID1
   - "Client.on("user-joined")" box (second occurrence): UID 1 rejoin channel

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
   - The note "Network interruption" is positioned above the "T5" box, indicating a network interruption occurring at that point in the flow.
