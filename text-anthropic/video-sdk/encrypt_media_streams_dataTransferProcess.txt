1. Overall Structure:
- This is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
- The main entities are: User A, App A, SDK A, agora (cloud service), SDK B, App B, and User B.
- Within App A and App B, there are smaller boxes labeled "enableEncryption" and "Audio & video collection & encoding".

3. Data Flow:
- There are solid lines connecting App A to SDK A, SDK A to the agora cloud, the agora cloud to SDK B, and SDK B to App B. These lines represent the flow of encrypted media streams.
- There are also dashed lines from App A to SDK A, and from SDK B to App B, indicating the transport encryption mode, key, and salt.
- The elements are grouped into two main sections separated by the agora cloud service.

4. Detailed Content:

5. Configuration or Additional Notes:
- At the bottom, there are two smaller boxes with the text "Generate keys and salts on your server".
- There are also two arrows pointing from these boxes to App A and App B, labeled "Encryption transport key and salt".
