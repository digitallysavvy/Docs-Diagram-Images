3. Data Flow:
- There are solid lines with arrows indicating the direction of data flow between the entities.
- The flow starts from the "App" entity to the "Video SDK" and then to the "Agora SD-RTN" entity.
- There is a dashed line from the "Agora SD-RTN" entity to the "App" entity, representing a response or data flow in the opposite direction.
- There is a grouping of elements within the "App" entity, titled "If the user role is 'host'".
