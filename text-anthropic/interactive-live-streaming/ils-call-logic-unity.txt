1. Overall Structure:
   - This is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - The main entities are "User", "Your game", "Agora", "Host", and "Audience".
   - Within "Your game" there is a sub-element labeled "Video SDK".

3. Data Flow:
   - Solid lines represent the flow of data or method calls between entities.
   - Dashed lines represent the return of data or methods.
   - There is a grouping titled "Start a live streaming event" that encompasses interactions between "Your game", "Host", and "Agora".
   - There is another grouping titled "Join the live streaming event" that encompasses interactions between "Audience" and "Agora".

4. Detailed Content:
   - User: "Open game"
   - Your game (sub-element Video SDK): 
     "Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine: newline agoraEngine=IRtcEngine.GetEngine()"
     "Setup the local video stream: newline agoraEngine.EnableVideo()"
     "agoraEngine.EnableVideoObserver()"
   - Host (within "Start a live streaming event" group):
     "Retrieve authentication token to join channel" 
     "Enable live streaming in the channel: newline agoraEngine.SetChannelProfile(CHANNEL_PROFILE.CHANNEL_PROFILE_LIVE_BROADCASTING)"
     "Set the user role as host: newline agoraEngine.SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE.CLIENT_ROLE_BROADCASTER)"
     "Join a channel as host: newline agoraEngine.JoinChannelByKey()"
     "Send data stream"
   - Audience (within "Join the live streaming event" group):
     "Retrieve authentication token to join channel"
     "Set the user role as audience: newline agoraEngine.SetClientRole(CLIENT_ROLE_TYPE.CLIENT_ROLE_AUDIENCE)"
     "Join the channel: newline agoraEngine.JoinChannelByKey()"
     "A callback to start remote video: newline onUserJoined()"
     "Retrieve streaming from the hosts: newline RemoteView.SetForUser(uid)"
     "Receive data Stream"
   - User: "Leave the live streaming event"
   - Your game:
     "Leave the channel: newline agoraEngine.leaveChannel()"
     "Stop local video stream: newline agoraEngine.DisableVideo()"
     "Disable the video observer: newline agoraEngine.DisableVideoObserver()"
   - User: "Close game"
   - Your game (sub-element Video SDK): "Clean up local resources: newline agoraEngine.destroy()"
