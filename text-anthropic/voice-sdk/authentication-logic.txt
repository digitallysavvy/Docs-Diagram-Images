1. Overall Structure:
This is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
- Token server (box)
- App (box)
- SD-RTN (box)
- Join a channel with authentication (sub-element within Token server)
- Renew token (sub-element within Token server)

3. Data Flow:
- A solid line with an arrow flows from App to Token server, labeled "Request a token using channel name, role, token type, and user ID".
- A dashed line flows from Token server to itself, labeled "Validate user against internal security".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from Token server to App, labeled "Generate a token and return it to the client".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from App to SD-RTN, labeled "Join a channel with uid, channel name, and token".
- A dashed line flows from SD-RTN to itself, labeled "Validate the token".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from SD-RTN to App, labeled "Trigger the callback after adding user to the channel".
- A dashed line with an arrow flows from App to Token server, labeled "Trigger event: Token Privilege will Expire".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from App to Token server, labeled "Request a fresh token using channel name, role, token type, and user ID".
- A dashed line flows from Token server to itself, labeled "Validate user request against internal logic".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from Token server to App, labeled "Generate a fresh token and return it to the client".
- A solid line with an arrow flows from App to SD-RTN, labeled "Send the fresh token with a RenewToken request".
