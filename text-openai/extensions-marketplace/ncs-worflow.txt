1. **Overall Structure:**
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram.

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - There are four primary vertical entities or boxes, each labeled as follows: "Web server", "App", "SD-RTN", "ActiveFence". 
   - The entity "Web server" and "App" are grouped under the heading "Implemented by you".
   - "SD-RTN" and "ActiveFence" are grouped under "Provided by Agora" and "Provided by ActiveFence" respectively.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid arrows are used to depict the direction of interaction between entities:
     - From "User" to "Web server" labeled "Login".
     - From "Web server" to "SD-RTN" labeled "Login authentication".
     - From "Web server" to "App" labeled "Join channel".
     - From "App" to "SD-RTN" labeled "Join channel with ActiveFence activated".
     - From "SD-RTN" to "ActiveFence" labeled "Monitor content in channel".
     - From "ActiveFence" to "App" labeled "Content matches workflow risk".
     - From "App" to "Web server" labeled "Act on webhook. For example, use Channel Management REST API to remove user from channel", followed by "Log user out".
     - From "Web server" to "User" labeled "Logout".
   - Dashed lines indicate return paths or acknowledgments for the sequences initiated.

4. **Detailed Content:**
   - "User" entity: N/A
   - "Web server" entity contains the sequence of actions: "Login new line Join channel new line Act on webhook. For example, use Channel Management REST API to remove user from channel new line Log user out".
   - "App" entity contains the sequence of actions: "Join channel new line Content matches workflow risk".
   - "SD-RTN" entity: links directly, but does not show direct actions or internal processes.
   - "ActiveFence" entity contains a single action labeled "Monitor content in channel".

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**
   - No additional lines or configuration notes are visibly specified outside the main sequence interactions depicted with the arrows. 

This structured format of the sequence diagram highlights the interactions and data flow between user, web applications, services, and monitoring tools, through a series of login, authentication, monitoring, and logout sequences.
