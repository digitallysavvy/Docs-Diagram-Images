2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - The main entities represented as boxes are "User", "Your app", "Voice SDK", and "Agora".
   - Each entity "Your app" and "Agora" includes a sub-element "SD-RTN" as a smaller box.
   - The "Voice SDK" is a component within "Your app" entity, shown twice, near the top and bottom.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid lines show interactions between the entities, indicating the flow of data or commands with arrows pointing in the direction of the flow.
   - There are dashed lines representing response or return actions within the sequence.
   - The interactions are grouped into phases labeled directly on the diagram: "Join", "Publish and Subscribe", and "Common workflows".
