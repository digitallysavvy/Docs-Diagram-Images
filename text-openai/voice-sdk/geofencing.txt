### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram.

### Main Entities and Elements:
1. **User**: Represents a user interacting with an application.
2. **App**: Box labeled "App" indicating the application module being used by the user.
3. **SD-RTN**: Box labeled "SD-RTN" indicating an external service or network component managed by Agora.

### Data Flow:
- **Solid Lines**: Represent the sequence of steps and interactions between the user, app, and SD-RTN. These lines indicate the direction of the interaction from left to right and right to left, suggesting a request-response communication pattern.
- **Dashed Lines**: Vertical dashed lines represent the flow of time for each participant in the scenario.
- **Groupings and Titles**:
   - A titled group called "Geofencing" encapsulates multiple interactions involving setting up and initiating a connection between the app and SD-RTN.

### Detailed Content:
- **User**:
  - "Start the app"
  - "Select a channel to join"
- **App**:
  - First Instance:
    - "Set SD-RTN region in the Agora engine configuration newline Initiate the Agora engine"
    - "Join a channel with user Id, channel name, and token"
  - Second Instance (response to selecting a channel):
    - "Join accepted"
- **SD-RTN**:
  - "Connect to SD-RTN in a specific region"
  - "Success response"

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- Above the "App" box, a note states "Implemented by you" indicating that the app component needs to be implemented by the user.
- Next to the "SD-RTN" box, a note states "Provided by Agora" indicating that the SD-RTN is a service provided by Agora.
