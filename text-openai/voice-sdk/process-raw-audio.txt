### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram, which depicts the interactions between different entities over time in a process.

### Main Entities and Elements:
1. **User**: Illustrated as a stick figure.
2. **Your app**: Represented with a box containing sub-elements.
3. **Agora**: Indicated by a box labeled "SD-RTN".

#### Sub-elements:
- **Voice SDK**: Found within the "Your app" box, contains grouped sequential actions.
- **SD-RTN**: Found next to "Agora", but no sub-elements are detailed.

### Data Flow:
- **Solid Lines**: Represent the execution flow, initiating from the "User" and progressing through "Your app" with responses to "Agora".
- **Dashed Lines**: Show the return of data or results back to either the "User" or "Your app".
  
### Groupings of Elements:
1. **Setup raw data processing**
   - Actions: "Setup the audio frame observer".
2. **Join a channel**
   - Actions: "Register the audio frame observer", "Set audio frame parameters", "Retrieve authentication token to join a channel", "Join the channel".
3. **Process raw audio data**
   - Actions: "Get the raw data in the callbacks", "Send the processed data back with the callbacks".
4. **Leave**
   - Actions: "Unregister the audio frame observer", "Leave the channel".
  
### Detailed Content:
- **Open App**
  - Present between the User and Voice SDK.
- **Create an instance of Agora Engine using Voice SDK**
  - Flow from Voice SDK to SD-RTN.
- **Setup the audio frame observer**: In "Voice SDK" returning back.
- **Register the audio frame observer** and **Set audio frame parameters**: Flow within "Voice SDK".
- **Retrieve authentication token to join a channel** and **Join the channel**: Flow within "Voice SDK".
- **Get the raw data in the callbacks** and **Send the processed data back with the callbacks**: Within "Voice SDK".
- **Unregister the audio frame observer** and **Leave the channel**: Flow from "Voice SDK".

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- There are no specific configuration settings or additional notes indicated, just the linear interaction flows and return paths depicted by solid and dashed lines respectively.
