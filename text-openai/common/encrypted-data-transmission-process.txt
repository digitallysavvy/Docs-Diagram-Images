1. **Overall Structure:**
   - Type of diagram: Flow diagram.
   - Direction of the diagram: Top-to-bottom and bi-directional (left-to-right between two main entities).

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - Two main entities labeled "Client A" and "Client B" are depicted at the far left and far right of the diagram.
   - Each client contains two primary components: "App A/B" and "SDK A/B", each enclosed in dashed boxes. 
     - "App A" and "App B" each have a sub-element labeled "Customized Encryption".
     - "SDK A" and "SDK B" contain the elements "Built-in encryption", and smaller boxes labeled "Audio / Video & encoding" and "Audio/Video decoding and rendering", respectively.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Data flows from "Client A" to "Client B":
     - Begins from "Audio / Video & encoding" in SDK A, passes through "Built-in encryption" and "Encrypted data" (highlighted in a smaller box), and then moves upwards.
     - Through the cloud labeled "Agora SD-RTN™", indicating encrypted data transmission.
     - Data flows down into "SDK B" moving through "Encrypted data", "Built-in encryption", and finally into "Audio/Video decoding and rendering".
   - The reverse flow for RETURN data is implied, though not explicitly visualized.

4. **Detailed Content:**
   - Labels at SDK A and SDK B:
     - SDK A: "Built-in encryption" newline "Audio / Video & encoding"
     - SDK B: "Built-in encryption" newline "Audio/Video decoding and rendering"
   - At the central cloud: "Agora SD-RTN™" newline "Encrypted data transmission"
   - Horizontal labels indicate the flow:
     - Above the cloud: "Encryption data upstream transmission"
     - Below the cloud: "Encryption data downstream transmission"

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**
   - Each large entity (Client A and Client B) has a boundary marked with dashed lines, indicating their separation and individual functionalities within the system.
   - There are two horizontal arrows at the top and bottom of the cloud indicating bidirectional flow of encrypted data.
