### Overall Structure
- The diagram is a flow chart.
- The direction of the diagram is left-to-right.

### Main Entities and Elements
#### Client A
- Contains App A and SDK A.
  - App A contains the settings: "setEncryptionMode" and "setEncryptionSecret."
  - SDK A contains "Audio/Video capture and encoding."
  
#### Client B
- Contains App B and SDK B.
  - App B contains the settings: "setEncryptionMode" and "setEncryptionSecret."
  - SDK B contains "Audio/Video capture and rendering."

#### Edge Server A
- Contains "Media stream encryption."

#### Edge Server B
- Contains "Media stream decryption."

### Data Flow
- Solid lines indicate data transmission paths:
  - From SDK A to Edge Server A: "DLTS encryption Media stream transmission."
  - From Edge Server A to Edge Server B: "Encrypted data transmission."
  - From Edge Server B to SDK B: "DLTS encryption Media stream transmission."
- Additional solid lines: 
  - From App A to SDK A, and from App B to SDK B: "HTTPS/WSS encryption method and secret key transmission."

### Configuration or Additional Notes
- Placed centrally above the Edge Servers, highlighting the data transmission method between them.
- Labels near connections specify the type of transmission. For instance:
  - "DLTS encryption Media stream transmission" indicates the encryption type used between SDKs and Edge Servers.
  - "HTTPS/WSS encryption method and secret key transmission" indicates how encryption settings are transmitted within the Apps to the SDKs.
