     - "Join channel"
   - Sub-elements:
     - Rectangular boxes: "video module" and "network module" placed on the top, slightly outside the main flow.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid lines indicate the flow of data:
     - From "Enable local video collection" to "Video pre-processing"
     - From "Video pre-processing" to "Video Encoding"
     - A separate line from "Video pre-processing" back down to "Video post-processing"
     - From "Video Encoding" to "Local Preview"
     - Downward line from "Local Preview" to "Join channel" in the network module
     - From "Video post-processing" to "Video Decoding"
     - From "Video Decoding" to "Video rendering display"

4. **Detailed Content:**
   - Contents within each box are:
     - Enable local video collection
     - Video pre-processing
     - Video Encoding
     - Local Preview
     - Video post-processing
     - Video Decoding
     - Video rendering display

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**
   - Remarks on position:
     - "video module" label is positioned above the sequence from "Enable local video collection" to "Local Preview".
     - "network module" label is positioned above the "Join channel" box.
     - The layout is configured with a backdrop of dashed lines that seem to divide the flow into two main sections with the sections labeled as "video module" and "network module".
