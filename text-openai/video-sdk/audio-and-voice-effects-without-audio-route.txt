### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram that illustrates interaction and data flow between entities in an application that utilizes video SDK.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **User**: Represented as a labeled stick figure at two different points - top and bottom of the diagram.
- **Your app**: A rectangular box labeled accordingly, serving as the main application interface.
- **Video SDK**: Multiple instances of this rectangular box appear, indicating different points of interaction.
- **Agora**: Another rectangular box labeled as such, interacting with "Your app" and "Video SDK".
- **SD-RTN**: A rectangular box appearing on the right side, interacting with "Video SDK".

### Data Flow:
- Solid arrows indicate the direction of interaction and control flow within the diagram:
  - From "User" to "Your app" initiating the action "Open App".
  - Multiple interactions between "Your app" and "Video SDK", including the creation and configuration of the Agora Engine.
  - Interactions extend from "Video SDK" to "Agora", establishing and managing audio and video functionalities.
  - Data flows back to "User" through "Video SDK" at various points, particularly after actions within "Your app".
- Solid lines also indicate sequenced interactive steps within specific groupings like "Join", "Play audio effect", "Audio mixing", and "Voice effects".

### Groupings and Title:
- **Join**: Encompasses actions related to joining a communication channel.
- **Play audio effect**: Involves triggering, playing, pausing, and managing sound effects.
- **Audio mixing**: Centers around starting and stopping audio mixing processes.
- **Voice effects**: Focuses on applying and adjusting voice effects.

### Detailed Content:
- Each box within the entities contains sequenced actions:
  - "Your app": newline Create an Agora Engine instance using Video SDK newline Enable audio and video in Agora Engine
  - "Video SDK" (within "Join"): newline Join a channel newline Retrieve authentication token to join a channel newline Join the channel
  - "Video SDK" (within "Play audio effect"): newline Trigger sound effect newline Play effect newline Pause and resume effect newline Set effect position newline Set effect volume newline On audio effect finished
  - "Video SDK" (within "Audio mixing"): newline Control audio mixing newline Start audio mixing newline Stop audio mixing
  - "Video SDK" (within "Voice effects"): newline Apply a voice effect newline Set preset voice effect newline Disable the voice effect
  - "Video SDK" (within "Leave the channel"): newline Leave the channel

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- No additional notes or configuration settings are specified outside of the primary boxes or groups in the diagram. The interactions and configurations are self-contained within the respective entities and their relationships as articulated by the flow arrows.
