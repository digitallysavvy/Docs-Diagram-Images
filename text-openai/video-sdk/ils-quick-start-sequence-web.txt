### Overall Structure:
- Type of diagram: Sequence Diagram

### Main Entities and Elements:
1. **App**:
   - Main box labeled "App".
2. **Video SDK**:
   - Main box labeled "Video SDK".
3. **Agora SD-RTN**:
   - Main box labeled "Agora SD-RTN".
4. **Groupings**:
   - "Create and publish local audio and video tracks"
   - "Subscribe to remote users"
   - "Leave the channel"

### Data Flow:
- **Connections**:
   - Solid lines run vertically alongside each main entity, showing the sequence of operations.
   - Dashed horizontal lines represent data or requests being sent between entities.
   - Arrows indicate the direction of data flow or request initiation.
- **Grouping Titles**:
   - The operations or actions within each of the groups (mentioned above) are segmented by labeled dashed lines across the diagram.

- **Video SDK Content**:
  - No specific text content, acts as a relay for data.

- **Agora SD-RTN Content**:
  - No specific text content, acts as an endpoint for receiving channel join and leave requests, and relay of audio/video data.

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- **Connections**:
  - "Join channel request", "Send audio and video data", and "Receive audio and video data" are specifically marked, demonstrating flow initiation and reception between entities.
- **Positioning**:
  - Configuration settings for creating a local client are detailed within the App entity at the start of the flow.
- **Additional Boxes**:
  - Separate smaller boxes within the main entity boxes are used to encapsulate specific commands or method calls, clarifying the sequence of actions.
