1. **Overall Structure**
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram used to represent a process over time.

2. **Main Entities and Elements**
   - There are three main entities represented as boxes at the top of the diagram:
     - **App**: Symbolized by a box with an icon of a desktop monitor.
     - **Video SDK**: Indicated by a box with two overlapping square icons.
     - **Agora SD-RTN**: Represented by a box with a cloud icon.
   - A titled group "Screen sharing" encloses the sequence of actions related to screen sharing across the entities.

3. **Data Flow**
   - Starting from the **App** entity:
     - Solid lines extend from **App** to **Video SDK** indicating directional flow of actions (e.g., "Get available screen or window information" and responses such as "Return available screen or window information").
     - Within **App**, the flow continues downwards through several steps like "Start screen capture", "Set the screen sharing scene (optional)", and finally "Stop screen sharing".
   - Lines connect the **Video SDK** to the **Agora SD-RTN** to show the forwarding of actions:
     - "Publish the screen sharing stream in the channel" starts from **Video SDK** to **Agora SD-RTN**.
     - This connection includes subsequent updates and eventual stopping of the stream publishing.

4. **Detailed Content**
   - In **App**: 
     - Get available screen or window information newline
     - Return available screen or window information newline
     - Start screen capture newline
     - Set the screen sharing scene (optional) newline
     - Join the channel newline
     - Update the screen sharing area or parameters newline
     - Display stroke on the shared screen (optional) newline
     - Block window (optional) newline
     - Stop screen sharing
   - In **Video SDK** to **Agora SD-RTN**:
     - Publish the screen sharing stream in the channel newline
     - Publish the updated screen sharing stream in the channel newline
     - Stop publishing the screen sharing stream in the channel

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes**
   - No additional lines or notes indicated within the diagram outside the basic sequence and interactions described.
