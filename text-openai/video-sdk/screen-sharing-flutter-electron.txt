1. **Overall Structure**
   - Type of diagram: Sequence.

2. **Main Entities and Elements**
   - There are four main rectangular boxes labeled:
     1. `getScreenCaptureSources`
     2. `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`
     3. `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`
     4. `joinChannelEx (publishScreenTrack: true)`
   - Each box is connected to smaller rectangular sub-elements labeled:
     - `displayId` connected to the second box.
     - `windowId` connected to the third box.
   - A distinct cloud-shaped entity labeled "Agora SD-RTN™".

3. **Data Flow**
   - Solid lines show connections indicating the flow of activity. The flow is from left to right, signifying sequences of operations:
     - A line from the `getScreenCaptureSources` box splits into two branches:
       - One line flows into `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`.
       - Another line flows into `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`.
     - Both `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId` and `startScreenCaptureByWindowId` converge into a single line that connects to `joinChannelEx`.
     - A line from `joinChannelEx` extends to the cloud-shaped entity "Agora SD-RTN™".

4. **Detailed Content**
   - Text content within each box is as follows:
     - `getScreenCaptureSources`: No internal text indicated.
     - `startScreenCaptureByDisplayId`: No internal text indicated.
     - `startScreenCaptureByWindowId`: No internal text indicated.
     - `joinChannelEx`: (publishScreenTrack: true)

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes**
   - No additional notes or configuration settings are indicated beyond the labels and content directly associated with the diagram's boxes and connections.
