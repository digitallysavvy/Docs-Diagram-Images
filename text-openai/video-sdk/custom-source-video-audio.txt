1. **Overall Structure:**
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram, utilized to demonstrate the interaction and data flow between components over time.

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - Main entities represented as boxes:
     - **Your app**: Central application using the Video SDK.
     - **Agora**: Platform providing SD-RTN services.
   - Sub-elements within "Your app" 
     - **Video SDK**: Acts as the interface component in the app managing the interactions.
   - Solid vertical lines represent the lifespan or period of activity for each entity.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid lines with arrowheads depict the active communication and requests between entities, indicating the flow of operations and responses:
     - Lines flowing from **User** to **Your app** moving through **Video SDK** indicate user-initiated actions and system responses.
     - Communication often involves back-and-forth messages between **Video SDK** and **SD-RTN** for joining channels, streaming, and leaving channels.
   - Dashed lines (lifelines) indicate the timeline or the period during which interactions occur.

4. **Detailed Content:**
   - **User** interacts by:
     - **Open App** 
     - **Leave the channel**
   - **Your app** operations within **Video SDK**:
     - **Create an instance of the Video SDK engine** newline
     - **Enable audio and video in the engine** newline
     - **Setup external source**: newline
         - **Check the external source for compatibility** newline
         - **Set external video or audio source**
     - **Join**: newline
         - **Join a channel** newline
         - **Retrieve authentication token to join a channel** newline
         - **Join the channel**
     - **Process data**: newline
         - **Manage capturing and processing using external methods**
     - **Stream data**: newline
         - **Push external video or audio frame**

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**
   - No explicit configurations or additional notes outside the main descriptive content within the diagram are noted or represented in a distinguished manner. The diagram focuses primarily on the flow of operations within the designated software interactions.
