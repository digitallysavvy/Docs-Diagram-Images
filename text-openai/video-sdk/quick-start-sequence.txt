- The sequence diagram shows the interaction between App: Host, Video SDK, and App: Audience through a series of solid and dashed lines indicating sequence and response.
- The solid lines generally represent a call or an action being sent, and they flow left to right across the diagram connecting the relevant entities (from App: Host to Video SDK, and from Video SDK to App: Audience).
- The dashed lines usually indicate the response or acknowledgment of an action, with arrows pointing in the direction of the response flow.
