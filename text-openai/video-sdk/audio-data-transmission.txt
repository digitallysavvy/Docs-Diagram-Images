1. **Overall Structure:**
   - The diagram is a flow diagram.
   - The direction of the diagram is from left to right.

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - There are three main rectangular boxes aligned horizontally. These include:
     - "Specially collected audio"
     - "Collection Module"
     - "SDK"
   - "Collected audio frames" is labeled on an arrow between the second and third boxes.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid lines with arrows indicate the flow of data:
     - From "Specially collected audio" to "Collection Module".
     - From "Collection Module" to "SDK", through an intermediary arrow labeled "Collected audio frames".

4. **Detailed Content:**
   - The box labeled "Collection Module" does not contain additional text content inside.

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**
   - No additional lines or configuration notes are visible outside the main entities.

There are no groupings with titles, and no other symbols or distinguishing marks outside the described elements and flow. The background is a dark grid, providing a visual guide but not contributing additional information to the function or content of the flow diagram.
