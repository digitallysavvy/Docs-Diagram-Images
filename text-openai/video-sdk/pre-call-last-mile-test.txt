### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram used to represent the interaction and data flow between different software components.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **App**: Represented as a vertical box with the label "App". Inside, there is an icon of a mobile device.
- **SDK**: A vertical box labeled "SDK", containing an icon of overlapping squares indicating software layers or integration.
- **SD-RTN Edger Server**: Another vertical box labeled "SD-RTN Edger Server" with a cloud icon inside, symbolizing a server or cloud service.

### Data Flow:
- A solid line from "App" to "SDK" labeled "Start last mile probe test" indicating initiation of a process.
- From "SDK" to "SD-RTN Edger Server", a solid line is marked "Send uplink network probe packet" showing data being sent to the server.
- A dashed line returns from "SD-RTN Edger Server" to "SDK" labeled "Return the uplink confirmation packet", depicting the response from the server.
- Another solid line from "SDK" to "SD-RTN Edger Server" labeled "Send downlink network probe packet" represents another data transfer to the server.
- A dashed line from "SDK" to "App" labeled "Report network quality statistics", showing the results being sent back to the application.
- A solid line from "App" to "SDK" labeled "Stop last mile probe test" marks the end of the testing process.

### Detailed Content:
- **App**:
   - Start last mile probe test
   - Stop last mile probe test
   - Report network quality statistics (listed as incoming data on the dashed line)
- **SDK**:
   - Send uplink network probe packet
   - Return the uplink confirmation packet
   - Send downlink network probe packet
- **SD-RTN Edger Server**:
   - Textually, no specific actions are labeled inside the box; actions are described on connecting lines.

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- The vertical dashed lines behind each entity mark the lifetime or period of activity of each entity during the sequence of operations.
- The overall configuration and flow are set to illustrate the network testing procedures involving sending and receiving packets and reporting the statistics relevant to network performance.
