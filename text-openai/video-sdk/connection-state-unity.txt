### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a flow diagram.
- The direction of the diagram is left-to-right.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **Blue Rectangles**: 
  - "JoinChannel": Label "Join channel".
  - "OnJoinChannelSuccess": Label "Joined the channel successfully".
  - "OnConnectionStateChanged": Labels "CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_SUCCESS" and "Network connection successful"; and "CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING, CONNECTION_CHANGED_INTERRUPTED" respectively.
  - "OnConnectionLost": Label "Network connection interrupted".
  - "OnConnectionStateChanged": Label "CONNECTION_STATE_FAILED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_FAILED" and "Network connection failed".

- **Green Rectangles**:
  - "OnUserJoined": Label "Remote user comes online".
  - "OnUserOffline (reason USER_OFFLINE_DROPPED)": Label "Remote user is offline".

- **Dark Rectangles (TIMERS)**:
  - "T0", "T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5", "T6", "T7": Basic timers or stages in the flow.
  
- **Black Rectangles with white text (UID)**:
  - "UID 1"
  - "UID 2"

- **Blue Ellipse**:
  - "SDK automatically reconnects".

### Data Flow:
- Solid arrows represent the flow of processes.
- Dashed arrows indicate alternative or conditional flows.
- The diagram has groups structured around connection states, with specific actions taken when user IDs are involved (UID 1 and UID 2).
  
### Detailed Content:
- "JoinChannel": "Join channel".
- "OnJoinChannelSuccess": "Joined the channel successfully".
- "OnConnectionStateChanged": Text includes "CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_SUCCESS", "Network connection successful" newline "CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING, CONNECTION_CHANGED_INTERRUPTED", "Re-establishing Network connection".
- "OnConnectionLost": "Network connection interrupted".
- "OnConnectionStateChanged": "CONNECTION_STATE_FAILED, CONNECTION_CHANGED_JOIN_FAILED" newline "Network connection failed".
- "OnUserJoined": "Remote user comes online".
- "OnUserOffline (reason USER_OFFLINE_DROPPED)": "Remote user is offline".

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- Configuration settings or additional notes are not explicitly described beyond the SDK's automatic reconnection indicated by a dashed arrow from "T5" reconnecting back to "T1".
