### Overall Structure:
The diagram is a sequence diagram which visually represents a system's process or function over time between multiple entities or actors.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **User**: An entity initiating and closing the application operations.
- **Your app**: This box interacts directly with the "Video SDK" acting as the middleware.
- **Video SDK**: This is the central entity handling detailed operations for video processing and streaming using an embedded platform ("Agora").
- **Agora**: Depicted as SD-RTN in the diagram, indicating a specialized service or framework.
- **Host**: Represents a user or system component that manages and broadcasts the live streaming event.
- **Audience**: Users or systems receiving the data stream from the host.

### Data Flow:
- Solid arrows indicate direct actions or commands being sent from one entity to another.
- Dashed arrows represent return responses or sequences.
- Both solid and dashed lines are labeled with descriptions of their functionality such as "Open app", "Initiate the Video SDK engine", etc.

### Detailed Content:
- **User**:
  - "Open app".
  - "Close app".
- **Your app**:
  - Interacts sequentially with "Video SDK": 
    - "Initiate the Video SDK engine: AgoraEngine = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine".
    - "Start video in the engine: agoraEngine.enableVideo()".
- **Video SDK**:
  - Commands to manage the video in live streaming and audience interaction:
    - To **Host**: "agoraEngine.setClientRole(broadcaster)", "agoraEngine.setupLocalVideo(videoCanvas)", "agoraEngine?.joinChannel", "Send data stream".
    - To **Audience**: "agoraEngine.setClientRole(audience)", "agoraEngine?.joinChannel", "agoraEngine.setupRemoteVideo(videoCanvas)", "Receive data streams".
  - Cleanup on app close: "agoraEngine.stopPreview()", "agoraEngine.leaveChannel(nil)", "AgoraRtcEngineKit.destroy()".
- **Host** actions:
  - "Start a live streaming event", "Join the channel", "Start local video".
- **Audience** actions:
  - "Join live streaming event", "Retrieve streaming from hosts", "Leave live streaming event".

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- The "Video SDK" and "Your app" have dedicated, respective connections to "SD-RTN" and "Agora" indicating that they operate with dependencies or are integrated with these technologies.
- Notes on usage of "Agora" as a shared engine, use as "broadcaster" or "audience" clarifies different roles that entities can assume in the streaming process.
