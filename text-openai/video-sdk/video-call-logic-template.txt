1. **Overall Structure:**
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram.

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**
   - **User:** Represented with a stick figure icon and two actions: "Open app" and "Close app."
   - **Your app:**

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Solid lines with arrowheads show the direction of interaction and sequence flow between:
     - User and Your app (from User to Your app and vice versa).
     - Your app and Agora, and within sub-elements themselves (from Your app to Agora and vice versa).
     - Host related actions and data flows are encapsulated within a grouping titled "In a call, all users broadcast to the channel," reflecting a scenario where the host is in a live streaming session.
