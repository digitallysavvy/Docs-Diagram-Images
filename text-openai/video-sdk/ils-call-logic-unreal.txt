### Overall Structure
- The diagram is a sequence diagram reflecting interactions among different components in a live streaming event using the Agora Video SDK.

### Main Entities and Elements
- **User**: Indicates the person using the application.
- **Video SDK**: Represents the software development kit used for video functionalities.
- **Your app**: Custom application utilizing the Video SDK.
- **Agora**: External service used for handling live streaming functions.
- **Host**: The entity responsible for starting and managing the live streaming event.
- **Audience**: Represents viewers participating in the live streaming event.
- **SD-RTN**: Symbolizes the service delivery real-time network.

### Data Flow
- Solid lines with arrows indicate direct requests or actions (e.g., "Open App", "Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine").
- Dashed lines with arrows represent returns or responses (e.g., acknowledgment of initiating the SDK engine).
- Each of these lines tracks from left to right or right to left, delineating interaction direction between entities.

### Detailed Content
- **User to Video SDK**:
  1. Open App → Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine: `agora::rtc::createAgoraRtcEngine()`
  2. Close app → Clean up local resources: `agoraEngine->release()`
- **Video SDK to Your app**:
  1. Enable the audio and video modules: newline
     `agoraEngine.enableVideo()` newline
     `agoraEngine.enableAudio()`
  2. Set the channel profile: newline
     `RtcEngineContext context` newline
     `context.channelProfile = CHANNEL_PROFILE_COMMUNICATION;`
- **Host interactions**:
  1. Start a live streaming event → ...→ Send data stream
  2. Corresponding responses and steps for setting up and starting the live streaming, including retrieving the authentication token and setting up local video.
- **Audience interactions**:
  1. Join a live streaming event → Retrieve streaming from the hosts: `agoraEngine->setupRemoteVideo()` → Receive data stream
  2. Including obtaining authentication token and setting the user role as audience.
- **Video SDK to Agora/SD-RTN and back**:
  Illustrated through continued interactions between the components for operations like joining channels and data streaming.

### Configuration or Additional Notes
- The positioning of the Video SDK between User and Agora/SD-RTN represents its role as a middleware facilitating the video streaming functionalities by interfacing user actions and network operations.
- The interactions are mainly command-response style facilitated through method calls and their returns.
