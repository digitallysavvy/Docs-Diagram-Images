1. Overall Structure:
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - There are three main entities or actors depicted as vertical dashed boxes with the following labels: "User", "Your app", and "Agora". Within "Your app", there is a sub-entity labeled "Video SDK". Within "Agora", there is a sub-entity labeled "SD-RTN".

3. Data Flow:
   - Connections between entities are represented by solid and dashed lines indicating the sequence of actions. Solid lines typically suggest the direction of initiating an action, while dashed lines indicate a response or result.
   - The diagram is divided into two major groupings with titles indicating phases of interaction: "Open app" at the start and "Close app" at the end.
   - The arrows flow predominantly from top to bottom, starting from the "User" and moving through "Your app" to "Agora", and responses flow in the opposite direction.
