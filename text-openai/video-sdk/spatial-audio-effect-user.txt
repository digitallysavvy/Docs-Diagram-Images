1. **Overall Structure:**  
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram, primarily used to illustrate the interaction and order of operations between various systems and processes.

2. **Main Entities and Elements:**  
   - There are three primary entities: 
     - "Local User" represented by a rectangular box with an icon symbolizing a person.
     - "Developer server" represented by a rectangular box with a computer/server icon.
     - "Agora SDK" represented by a rectangular box.
   - There are no sub-elements like circles or smaller boxes within these main entities.

3. **Data Flow:**  
   - Solid lines with arrows indicate the data flow, showing the sequence of operations:
     1. From "Local User" to "Developer server," labeled "1. Send local user spatial position."
     2. From "Developer server" to "Local User," labeled "2. Receive remote user spatial positions."
     3. From "Developer server" to "Agora SDK," extending across the diagram, labeled "3. Update local and remote user's spatial positions, set spatial audio parameters."

4. **Detailed Content:**  
   - Inside "Local User" and "Developer server" there are no additional lines of text other than the labels.
   - Inside "Agora SDK," there is no additional text.

5. **Configuration or Additional Notes:**  
   - No additional lines or configuration settings are noted in the diagram outside of the main content described. The positions and flows are clearly delineated by the directional arrows accompanying each step.
