### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram, which visualizes the interactions among different participants in a sequence of events.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **Token Server** (leftmost column): Acts as the service provider which handles token generation and renewal.
- **App** (middle column): Represents the application performing operations such as joining channels and managing token-related events.
- **SD-RTN** (rightmost column): Managed by 'Agora', this entity completes the authentication by validating the token and handles the channel operations with the user.

### Data Flow:
- **Join a channel with authentication**:
  - Solid lines show the flow of requests and responses between the Token Server and App for token requests and token generation.
  - A solid line with an arrow from App to SD-RTN represents joining the channel with token and user details.
  - Dashed lines returning from SD-RTN to App, indicating token validation and a callback event after adding the user to the channel.
- **Renew token**:
  - After the "Trigger event: Token Privilege will Expire" in SD-RTN, solid lines between the App and Token Server depict the request and generation of a new token.
  - A solid line shows sending the fresh token with a RenewToken request from App to SD-RTN.

### Detailed Content:
- **Token Server Content**:
  - "Join a channel with authentication":
    - Request a token using channel name, role, token type, and user ID newline
    - Validate user against internal security newline
    - Generate a token and return it to the client
  - "Renew token":
    - Request a fresh token using channel name, role, token type, and user ID newline
    - Validate user request against internal logic newline
    - Generate a fresh token and return it to the client
- **App Content**:
  - "Join a channel with authentication":
    - Join a channel with uid, channel name, and token newline
    - Validate the token newline
    - Trigger the callback after adding user to the channel
  - "Renew token":
    - Trigger event: Token Privilege will Expire newline
    - Send the fresh token with a RenewToken request

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- Above the Token Server and App, it is labeled "Implemented by you".
- Above SD-RTN, it is labeled "Provided by Agora". This specifies the division of responsibility between the user-implemented functions and the services provided by Agora.

This structured layout and content facilitation provide an organized view of the authentication sequence for channel access, indicating how token security and management are handled.
