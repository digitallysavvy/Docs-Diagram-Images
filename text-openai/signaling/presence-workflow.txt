### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram that describes interactions between entities over time.

### Main Entities and Elements:
- **User**: Represents the actions performed by the user.
- **Your app**: Contains processes and actions taking place within a custom application.
- **Signaling SDK**: Interfaces between "Your app" and "Agora" to handle signaling tasks.
- **Agora**: Represents a service or platform named Agora that interacts with the Signaling SDK.

### Data Flow:
- **Connections**: There are solid and dashed lines connecting the entities, indicating the flow of processes and responses.
  - Solid lines typically represent calls or actions initiated.
  - Dashed lines typically represent responses or results returned.
- **Groupings**:
  - **Initialize**: Involves user opening the app, and in "Your app", creating a signalingEngine instance, adding listeners, setting authentication, and logging in.
  - **Presence notifications**: Begins when the user joins a channel and includes subscribing to channel events and handling presence events.
  - **Presence queries**: Involves loading user lists and channel lists, corresponding calls to get online users and user channels in "Agora".
  - **User status**: Deals with setting and querying user statuses.
  - **Close**: Includes logging out actions both by the user and in the Signaling SDK.
