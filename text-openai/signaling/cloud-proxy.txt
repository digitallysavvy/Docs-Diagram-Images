1. Overall Structure:
   - The diagram is a sequence diagram, used to illustrate the flow and interactions between different entities in a process involving multiple components.

2. Main Entities and Elements:
   - The diagram includes several entities represented as labeled boxes aligned vertically. The main entities are:
     - User
     - Admin
     - App
     - Enterprise Firewall
     - Cloud Proxy
     - SD-RTN
   - Each of these entities has vertical dashed lines extending downwards which indicate the lifespan or the period of activity during the interactions.

3. Data Flow:
   - Solid lines with arrows are used to showcase the direction and sequence of interactions between entities:
     - An arrow from User to App labeled "Open the app".
     - Multiple arrows among App, Enterprise Firewall, and Cloud Proxy showing initialization and request processes.
     - Arrows between App and SD-RTN showing actions like "Join a channel", "Send data stream", and "Leave the channel".
   - Dashed arrows often denotes responses to requests, like "Join success" or feedback arrows labeled "Proxy information".
