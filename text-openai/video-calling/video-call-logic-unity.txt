### Overall Structure:
- The diagram is a sequence diagram.

### Main Entities and Elements:
1. **User**: Represented by a stick figure icon at the start and end of the process.
2. **Your app**: Contains a labeled box named "Video SDK".
3. **Agora**: Contains a labeled box named "SD-RTN".

### Data Flow:
- Solid and dashed lines depict interaction and response flows between User, Video SDK, and SD-RTN:
  - Solid lines typically represent a call or action initiation.
  - Dashed lines generally represent a response or data return.

### Detailed Content:
1. **Video SDK box**:
   - Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine: agoraEngine=IRtcEngine.GetEngine() newline
   - Setup the local video stream: agoraEngine.EnableVideo() newline
   - agoraEngine.EnableVideoObserver()

2. **Operations between User and Video SDK**:
   - Open game -> Initiate the Agora Video SDK engine. newline
   - Start call -> Join the channel: agoraEngine.JoinChannelByKey() newline
   - Join call -> A callback to start remote video: OnUserJoined() newline
   - Receive and send data stream newline
   - Leave call -> Leave the channel: agoraEngine.leaveChannel() newline
   - Close game -> Clean up local resources: agoraEngine.destroy()

3. **Operations within Video SDK during a call**:
   - Start, monitor, and end of local video stream management including enabling and disabling the video and observer.

4. **Interactions with SD-RTN**:
   - Data streams flow between Video SDK and SD-RTN to handle video streaming services, indicated by actions like joining and leaving channels.

### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- The flow is sequenced from initiating a video call to the destruction of resources indicating a typical lifecycle of a video communication session using the Agora SDK.
- The interactions are grouped under the different phases like opening the game, starting the call, joining the call, and leaving the call, visually separated by spaces for clarity.
