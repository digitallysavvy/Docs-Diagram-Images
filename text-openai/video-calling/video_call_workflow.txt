### Sequence Diagram Description

#### Overall Structure:
- Diagram Type: Sequence diagram.

#### Main Entities and Elements:
- Entities: 
  - Client (two instances with same label)
  - Token Server
  - Call Implementer
  - Agora Platform
- Sub-elements within entities: None specified.

#### Data Flow:
- Connections are indicated via both solid and dashed lines.
  - Solid lines indicate synchronous calls or actions (sending data or messages).
  - Dashed lines indicate response or return data.
- Direction of flow:
  - From left to right (Client to Token Server/Agora Platform, or Call Implementer to other entities).
  - Vertically within the same entity, some actions lead to another internally (e.g., "User login to implementor security" leads to "Authenticate and retrieve token").

#### Detailed Content:
- **Client**:
  - Setup client
    - User login to implementor security newline
    - Authenticate and retrieve token newline
    - Create client instance newline
    - Set client role: host
  - Run call
    - Connect to local audio and video resources
  - End call
    - Close audio and video newline
    - Leave call

- **Token Server**:
  - No internal actions shown, participates in responses.

- **Client** ('Agora Platform' interactions):
  - Setup client
    - User login to implementor security newline
    - Authenticate and retrieve token newline
    - Create client instance newline
    - Set client role: audience
  - Run call
    - Join channel newline
    - Send audio and video to channel
  - End call
    - Close audio and video newline
    - Leave call

- **Call Implementer**:
  - Group title: Call Implementer
  - Actions direct towards other entities as a mediator.
  - Mainly facilitates connection and authentication between Client and Agora Platform.

- **Agora Platform**:
  - Interacts directly under:
    - Join channel newline
    - Send audio and video to channel newline
    - Communicate newline
    - Close audio and video newline
    - Leave call

#### Configuration or Additional Notes:
- Configuration settings are not visibly noted outside of the activity descriptions.
- Communication patterns are notably asynchronous (except where arrows directly lead to immediate returns or responses).
